## ULTRAVIOLET

Players: **Dan, Joanna, Liam, Taylor**

System: **Delta Green**

Vibes: _horror, modern setting, narrative_

Status: **Completed**

A full Delta Green campaign starting before the characters became agents

</hgroup>

> Fledgling agents spiral into insanity as they struggle to stop the
> incursion  
> **at any cost**

For this campaign, I took a number of official scenarios and heavily
modified them to include common themes, move them closer together
in space and time, and foreshadow the later scenarios.

This is a complete theater-of-the-mind campaign. We don't use any
visuals--I just try to do my best with descriptions. I do occasionally
use some ambient audio to assist with immersion, but this is a live
production so it's nothing crazy.

## Troubles in Otari

Players: **Joanna, Liam, Marcello, Skye**

System: **Pathfinder 2nd Edition**

Vibes _adventure, fantasy, tactical combat_

Status: **Completed**

Checking out Pathfinder 2e, with the Beginner Box and its followup

</hgroup>

> A mysterious string of incidents strike the small town of Otari.
> Our group of adventurers step up to save the community.

We had been wanting to try out PF2e for a while, so I ran the adventures
designed as a tutorial and introduction to the game. I tried to keep the
game as close to the rules as written as possible so that we could get an
accurate feel for the system.

This one is run through foundry using its excellent PF2e support. So
we have pretty nice looking maps and tokens for everything. This campaign
is pretty strongly combat focused, as the system leans heavily in that
direction.

## Candlekeep

Players: **Joanna, Liam, Ryan, Trevor**

System: **Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition**

Vibes: _adventure, fantasy, mystery, tactical combat_

Status: **Completed**

Mysteries in and around Candlekeep, for some new players!

</hgroup>

> Our group of adventurers search for a tome esoteric enough to permit their

> archives

A friend's campaign needed to take a hiatus, so I stepped in to cover their
players with a short campaign in the meantime.

We weren't sure how long the hiatus would need to be, so we decided on playing
through some of the adventures from Candlekeep Mysteries until their original GM
was ready to get things going again. That way, we could finish the campaign at
the end of one of the short mysteries.

We started at level 3, and got through _Book of the Raven_, _Shemshine's Bedtime
Rhyme_, and _The Price of Beauty_.

Some of these players stuck around for future campaigns of mine!

## Destination | Divergence

Players: **Aria, Ashlee, Charlie, Keiran, Marcello, Nic, Skye, Taylor**

System: **Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition**

Vibes: _adventure, fantasy, tactical combat_

Status: **Completed**

The original, epic campaign that started this group

</hgroup>

> A bunch of strangers seek a secret society after a series of strange dreams.
> As they uncover more hidden truths, they discover a plot with the universe at
> stake

This one starts a little spotty while we get started. I was new to this and we
were all new to roleplaying with eachother. We soon find out style and our
footing, and it continually gets better as we go. I'm very proud of how it all
ended, and think it is still some of my best work. I don't think I'll ever do
another super-long campaign like this again (it spanned 4 years and 200
episodes), but I'm very glad I finished this one.

I recommend you start in the final arc. By that point, we've definitely improved
significantly, and it's easily the best part of the story. It's also relatively
self-contained. Previous arcs foreshadowed it, but most other plot threads were
already wrapped up before the heroes tackled this last, impossible task.
