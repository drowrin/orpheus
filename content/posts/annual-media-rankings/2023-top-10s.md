Of all forms of media I consumed in 2023, by far the top 3 were podcasts, games,
and manga, in that order. The elements of these 3 categories are hardly
comparable, but I think you'll notice some common patterns in my taste across
them.

For each entry, I've listed:

- **who made the thing**
- _some rough categorization and tags_
- and my personal thoughts

Each format of media also has one or more extra sections for things that didn't
make the list for a variety of reasons (like stuff from 2022 that I never made a
list for ðŸ’€).

# Podcasts

![Just 7 hours from greatness](/img/podcast-listen-duration.png)

This was truly the year of podcasts for me. Every year I find more and more, and
get deeper and deeper into the backlog, but this year was special. Podcasts were
my constant entertainment--the backdrop for whatever I was doing, be that work,
games, chores, or errands. If I wasn't socializing, chances were I was listening
to a podcast.

In this year I branched out and found many new favorites, creative inspirations,
and excellent communities. I found creative works that I enjoyed more than I
thought was possible for the medium. Then I found more that rose the bar even
further! Then more!

Everything on this list gets an absolute recommendation from me.

There's a lot of Glass Cannon on this list. I liked a few of their series
previously, but this year I really dug into the backlog of excellent shows they
have on record. At the time of writing, I've listened to everything they've done
except for their 3 oldest and longest campaigns. It's hardly fair though,
they're a network. The podcasts attributed to them below are not arcs of a
single story, or even in the same universe. They are entirely distinct shows
published under the same banner, though there is of course a ton of cast
crossover between them. If you've disliked something you tried from them
previously, it may still be worth checking something else out!

This particular list is not all stuff that came out this year. Just stuff I
listened to this year. Most of these are ongoing though.

## 1. Get in the Trunk

**The Glass Cannon Network**  
_Horror/Supernatural/Crime/Drama/Mystery_  
S1-3 _Oneshots & Shorts_, S4+ _Campaign_ Game: _Delta Green_

- Cinematic style, with characters taking over narration of some personal scenes
- Very emotive and talented Handler and players
- Extremely well prepared
- A wild campaign in an incredible game

This is it. My top choice of all time, at the time of writing. One of the few
podcasts I've re-listened to.

This show introduced me to Delta Green, an extremely cool game that has become
my favorite to listen to podcasts of, and a game I want to run much more of!
You'll see plenty more of it below.

The first 2 seasons are comprised of the network feeling out the game with
oneshots and short arcs, but still with some character threads to tie it all
together. The third season is a different GM on the network trying the game out
with a different style. The fourth season onwards is the legendary campaign
*Impossible Landscape*s, run by the original GM. That fourth season is where the
real magic is, and you can skip right to it! The other seasons will provide a
little bit more context, and they are very good listens on their own, but they
aren't necessary if you want to get to the best stuff straight away.

## 2. Haunted City

**The Glass Cannon Network**  
_Drama/Crime/Supernatural_  
_Campaign_ Game: _Blades in the Dark_

This is absolutely the best chemistry and improvised roleplaying I have ever
witnessed. The players are each excellent on their own, but they constantly try
to elevate each other as well. The GM is incredible at flying by the seat of his
pants and figuring out excellent, dramatic narrative beats at the drop of a hat.
None of the campaign is planned, it all just _happens_ in such a natural way.
Jared Logan, you're an inspiration to me.

This is, in my opinion, the best Blades in the Dark podcast out there. John
Harper, the game author himself, makes a point of showing up to the live
premiers and commenting on just how great it is.

Gah, I can't even mention some of the reasons why I love this so much without
spoiling them. Just go listen. It's worth it.

## 3. NGWD?: Something is Wrong Here

**The Glass Cannon Network**  
_Surreal/Drama/Horror_  
_Oneshot_ (in two parts lol, twoshot) Game: _Something is Wrong Here_

This one is short, but so, so good. One of the few podcasts I've relistened to,
and I've done so 4 times.

If you were part of my 3-and-a-half-year D&D 5e campaign, _Destination |
Divergence_, the final arcs were heavily inspired by this podcast. It only took
them 4 hours for that much creativity to seep into my brain.

_Something is Wrong Here_ is a oneshot game inspired by the works of David
Lynch. It's creepy. It's surreal. It's psychological. It's about normal people,
in a normal environment--or is it?

## 4. Time for Chaos

**The Glass Cannon Network**  
_Horror/Supernatural/Adventure/Mystery_  
_Campaign_ Game: _Call of Cthulhu 7e_

This is the Glass Cannon's playthrough of the legendary campaign, _Masks of
Nyarlethotep_. It features a GM with a true passion for the game and the genre
(also the lead GM of the main podcast on the network, and an extremely talented
dude), and some of my favorite players on the network.

It has a bit of a slow start, but it pays off extremely well. The psychological
places and chaos by the end of the first season were phenomenal.

Season 2 starts this month! Can't wait!

## 5. Blood of the Wild

**The Glass Cannon Network**  
_Fantasy/Exploration/Adventure_  
_Campaign_ Game: _Pathfinder 2e_

Another great match of players and GM. Excellent chemistry between everyone
here, but in a completely different vibe than the previously mentioned
high-chemistry podcasts. This is a fantasy podcast through-and-through, and the
player chemistry reflects it with bright, but serious moods. When the emotions
rise, you can really feel it. When the stakes are high, it's nail-biting. This
podcast feels like a power metal album about a fantasy coming-of-age story.

This runs through the _Quest for the Frozen Flame_ adventure path for Pathfinder
2e. It's all about prehistoric tribes, the split forces of fire and primal
might, and the power of found family.

Honestly, if I were more in the mood for fantasy lately, this would probably be
higher. If you're in the mood for fantasy, consider this an even higher
recommendation.

## 6. Pretending to be People

**Pretending to be People**  
_Comedy/Supernatural/Crime/Horror_  
_Campaign_ Game: _Delta Green_ + _Pulp Call of Cthulhu_

When I learned this podcast was highly inspired by TAZ, a ton of things about
the podcast made sudden sense. These guys do the TAZ thing better than TAZ, and
I love TAZ!

They've got a custom composed soundtrack. They've got excellent comedy. They've
got a wild and crazy story I can never predict (and I love that). They've got
players clearly invested in everything. They've got a GM who is great at
evocative descriptions, with a very attention-grabbing narration voice. They've
got zany NPCs and a nonsensical world that somehow maintains continuity.

They were also inspired by the Glass Cannon, if I recall correctly. So it's
probably no surprise it ended up so high on my list. It's a fusion of so many
things I love!

If you're a TAZ fan who hasn't been loving recent arcs and misses the old
greatness of earlier TAZ arcs, I recommend this podcast more than anything else
on this list.

## 7. TAZ: Amnesty

**The Adventure Zone**  
_Supernatural/Mystery/Comedy/Drama_  
_Campaign_ Game: _Monster of the Week_

I finally decided to give TAZ a try this year, and I'm glad I did! After looking
into the various arcs, I learned that they weren't all linear parts of a single
story, but just different shows on the same podcast feed. I wasn't in the mood
for a fantasy D&D story, so I skipped ahead. I listened to the arcs that had
games I was interested in hearing about, starting with the shortest. I'm glad I
stuck through it, because those short arcs did not paint a great picture of TAZ.

The last arc I was interested in as an outsider to the fandom was Amnesty...

...and what an arc it was.

I was completely on board at that point--Amnesty has made me a TAZ fan. I went
back for their original, highly lauded campaign, but this was still better.
Amnesty was absolutely an inspiration for me. It definitely helps that it hit
the right genre notes for me. I love urban fantasy, I love crime dramas, and I
love flashback-riddled conflicts. It was well paced. It was funny. The
overarching story culminated in what is probably still my favorite finale.

## 8. Strange Aeons

**The Glass Cannon Network**  
_Comedy/Supernatural/Adventure/Fantasy_  
_Campaign_ Game: _Pathfinder 1e_ + _Pathfinder 2e_

This is the Glass Cannon's live tour show. Every episode is one they recorded as
a live show in whatever city they were visiting at the time. So, episodes are
infrequent, but the energy of the crowd adds a ton. I've gotten to see this show
live, and I plan to do so again at every possible opportunity!

This show is on the goofier side, but it gets serious when it needs to--and it
needs to fairly frequently. It's the kind of show where they'll bust out a short
sound byte of AC/DC's Thunderstruck, Simon & Garfunkel's Sound of Silence, or
other instantly recognizable songs just for a joke.

Fun fact about Pathfinder 2e, the Cthulhu Mythos is cannon! This campaign is all
about exploring that.

> Praise log!

## 9. Stories & Lies

**Stories & Lies**  
_Drama/Horror/Supernatural/Crime/Mystery_  
_Campaign_ Game: _Delta Green_

I can't get enough Delta Green podcasts, and recommendations led me to this one.
Y'all, this has some of the best editing in any TTRPG podcast I've heard.
They've got excellent music and ambiance. They've got sound effects for
everything, at an unobtrusive but noticeable volume. They've got crazy voice
effects when they need them, though that isn't broken out often.

Beyond the editing though, they've got a great cast of players and a great
Handler. These folks are extremely talented at drama and portraying their
characters' mental states.

Unlike many others on this list, this one isn't really all that funny, but it
isn't seeking to be. It's got the vibe of a dark crime drama like True
Detective, and they nail it.

## 10. Dark Thoughts

**Chaos Engine**  
_Horror/Supernatural/Mystery/Crime_  
_Campaign_ Game: _Delta Green_

## Honorable mentions

- **TAZ** Balance (_Comedy/Adventure/Drama_ | _Campaign_)
  I love you, Balance, but there wasn't room.
- **TAZ** Steeplechase (_Comedy/Crime/Drama_ | _Campaign_) This one was very fun
  throughout, and I absolutely recommend it, but it doesn't quite hit the same
  emotional highs that the best of TAZ reaches. Any other year, and it would
  likely be up there.
- **GCN** Gatewalkers (_Fantasy/Adventure_ | _Campaign_) A little too soon to
  give an amazing review of this one. They just passed 15 episodes. However,
  this is exceptionally well put together. One of the few podcasts I go out of
  my way to watch certain moments on the youtube version. The video production
  is the best I've seen for a narrative podcast. I love, love, love everything
  about this podcast. Next year I predict it'll get on the list!

## Echoes of the Past

- **CR** Exandria Unlimited: Calamity (_Fantasy/Mystery/Drama_ | _Short Series_)
  I technically watched this in 2022. If I watched it in 2023, it would be a top
  3-5. This is the best content Critical Role has ever produced, hands down.

# Games

![I don't have good stats for this one, so here's my top 5 all time, ordered inside to out. It's relevant! This year landed 3 games in my top 5 ever! What a year.](/img/top5games.png)

What a fantastic year for games. There were far too many amazing ones, and not
nearly enough time to play all of them. I've included a section for the top
games I missed this year that I think I will love when I finally get around to
them.

This year saw multiple major upsets to my
[Top 25](https://www.backloggd.com/u/Drowrin/list/top-25/), both from games
released this year and older games I finally played this year.

## 1. Alan Wake 2

**Remedy Entertainment**  
_Horror/Mystery/Thriller/Psychological_  
_Survival Horror_

My choice for top writing of the year, as well as my personal Game of the Year!

2 weeks before the release of this game, I had never played a single game from
Remedy. My tastes were very different back when they came out. These days
though, the Remedy universe is all very much up my alley. So I _tore_ through
all the previous games that may be related to this one, even if it meant
delaying my start on this game by a few weeks. I'm glad I did! There were so
many tiny details that connected in really cool ways that it made it all worth
it, and I even discovered another new favorite game: Control!

This is currently the best looking game out there, and not just as a marketing
play. Remedy fuses IRL acting and rendered graphics constantly, and it works so
well because of just how well they managed to make this game look. It's got the
feel of a TV show more than a game, and that works so damn well for the
atmosphere. I want to soak in every inch of this game whenever I play it, and I
didn't even get to max it out!

I absolutely loved the evidence board mechanic, and how it evolved over the
course of the game. Extremely creative, extremely functional, and just downright
cool. Well done.

In my opinion, this is currently the absolute peak of the kind of game Remedy
were going for here. I consider this essentially a flawless game. It captivated
me constantly, and never stopped pleasantly surprising me. I really want to play
it again at some point, and try to 100% it to connect all the lore dots even
more.

## 2. Cyberpunk 2.0 | Phantom Liberty

**CD Projekt RED**  
_Adventure/Drama/Cyberpunk_  
_RPG/FPS_

I'm so happy we finally got the version of this game I can confidently call a
masterpiece.

I remember watching the original trailer for this back in... what, 2013? A long
time ago. I think that may have been what kickstarted my enjoyment of cyberpunk
as a genre.

I was one of the weird ones happy with the game on release. I didn't go in with
crazy expectations of this being a GTA killer or anything like that. I would be
happy if it was basically a fusion of a Bethesda release and Deus Ex. What we
got was good enough for me--a flawed game for sure, but I liked the core of it.
I gave it a 7/10, and put over a hundred hours into that version through
multiple playthroughs.

Then, slowly, over time, the game got better. By the end of the 1.X patches, I
had bumped the game up to an 8. So many issues had been fixed. The game played
smoothly and the sandbox got more and more fun. Most lingering bugs got
squashed. Additional content was added, free of charge.

2.0 drops. Everything changes for the better once again. Almost every single
element of the game changes in some way or another. Even minor tonal
inconsistencies in the story were fixed.

Now, what we've got is a masterpiece. Over the course of my fresh 2.0
playthrough, Cyberpunk 2077 skyrocketed into my top 5 games of all time. 3 More
playthroughs later, and after Phantom Liberty, it's in my top 3.

This game, especially Phantom Liberty, has emotionally touched me so many times.
I've cried, many times, playing this damn game. I'll be shocked if another game
makes me feel quite this way ever again, but I look forward to that day
nonetheless.

If I were ordering this list regardless of year, this game would be above Alan
Wake 2. However, I didn't feel it was right to name a game update and DLC as my
top of the year. So here it sits.

## 3. Final Fantasy XVI

**Square Enix**  
_Fantasy/Drama/Political Drama_  
_Action_

My choice for top gameplay and music of the year!

This game had the highest highs I have ever experienced in a videogame. It's not
close. It repeatedly raised the bar for itself, and then seemingly effortlessly
surpassed that bar and raised it again. For the strong emotional moments, it
never missed a single time.

It also has some of the most memorable, well choreographed, and well designed
bosses I've ever seen.

Unfortunately, it wasn't all strong emotional moments and memorable boss fights
throughout. There is a lot of superfluous content that would be better off left
out entirely. This game could use a "Director's Cut" or something similar. I
think some of the baggage of being a Final Fantasy game held it back. I'm not
complaining about chocobos, crystals, or
the-same-elemental-deities-named-something-different-again. Those are great! The
side quests, equipment system, and all the systems tangentially related do
nothing but drag the game down. The game would have been amazing with just the
main story and the main upgrade system.

Personally, I'm either very tolerant of those things or just numb to them at
this point after playing so much Final Fantasy. So it doesn't drag the game
beneath a 10/10 for me, but I wish we could get a version of the game that was
more focused. That might bump this game even higher in my top 5, and it would
make the game more enjoyable to tons of players out there.

Thank you Soken, my GOAT, for another banger soundtrack.

## 4. Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon

**FromSoftware**  
_Sci-Fi/Mecha_  
_Action_

I've never played another Armored Core game, but I loved this one! FromSoft
killing it once again. I don't have many notes on this one. I think the story
was forgettable, even after all the NG+ runs, but the gameplay more than made up
for it. Excellent mech customization. Excellent combat. Great music.

## 5. Warframe: Whispers in the Walls

**Digital Extremes**  
_Sci-Fi/Drama/Space Opera_  
_Looter Shooter_

This is, in my opinion, one of the best updates for a live service game I have
ever seen.

Everything worked smoothly. The new content and new rewards are fantastic. The
changes to base systems of the game made the sandbox healthier than it has ever
been. The _new_ systems (yes, multiple) are fantastic additions to the game and
will be part of my weekly ritual and moment-to-moment gameplay for years to
come.

Not only that, but this update ushers in the next arc of the story after the
last 10-year story ended, and it's so damn intriguing. We've had tons of crazy
lore drops. Theories abound in the community. I can't wait to see what they're
cooking up with this one. This update also featured what I think might be one of
the better written gay relationships in a videogame.

This update also took one of the older, more grindy systems in the game (an RNG
hell) and made it way more friendly. RNG protection! Convert drops you don't
want into progress for the ones you do want! Farm anywhere you want and convert
one thing into another at a fair rate!

Warframe is in a golden age right now.

## 6. Warframe: The Duviri Paradox

**Digital Extremes**  
_Sci-Fi/Drama/Space Opera_  
_Looter Shooter_

We've had one Warframe update, but what about second Warframe update?

That's right, Warframe not only had two S tier updates this year, they happened
back to back (if you zoom out to major/seasonal type updates).

This update had some really interesting writing. As the name implies, a paradox
is involved. Exploring that paradox helped explain a ton about some gaps in our
knowledge about the world, and neatly tied up many loose threads in the story at
once. Very well done! This felt like an update answering all the lingering
questions from the last arc (which started in 2013), to prepare us to start a
whole new arc with Whispers in the Walls.

Okay, cool, lore, whatever. What was the gameplay like?

This update added a whole new gameplay mode. Not a mission type. A whole new
mode. You play as an entirely different kind of character in what is essentially
an open-world roguelike with souls-like combat. The bullet-train speed of
Warframe gets dialed down to riding a horse across the dreamlike plains of a
corrupted fey civilization that doesn't exit. No more big guns. No more big
spells. You've got a sword, a hope, and a mysterious power you're starting to
discover. Time to go kick some toxic emotions in the teeth to fix the mental
health of the world itself.

But Digital Extremes didn't want to leave the core gameplay loop out of it
either. So they added _another_ different roguelike mode. Not only is it fun,
the rewards are great! You gain the ability to take old, nostalgic gear that got
powercrept 8 years ago and bring it up to the current meta. As of writing this,
those weapons are now some of the most powerful and fun weapons in the game. DE
sometimes goes back and adds new ones to that reward pool to get! But worry not,
no RNG in those rewards. If you want a specific weapon, you pick it and get a
progress bar. Perfection.

## 7. Chants of Sennaar

**Rundisc**  
_Hopepunk(?)_  
_Puzzle/Adventure/Point and Click_

This one came out of nowhere. I'm not really sure how to categorize its
narrative genre.

The gameplay is a linguistic/anthropologic puzzle. You start out knowing no
language at all, and by carefully observing others and the world around you, you
begin to piece together how to speak and read all these languages around you.
It's incredibly cleverly designed to be able to support this without it feeling
overwhelming. Concepts are introduced in an order that makes sense.

The conclusion of the game is also very satisfying.

## 8. Octopath Traveler 2

**Square Enix**  
_Fantasy_  
_RPG/Turn Based_

I haven't finished this one, but it deserves a spot.

I enjoyed the original well enough. I played it a couple times in order to get
different team compositions and explore some of the challenges from different
angles. It was a decent 7-8/10, neat little RPG.

This game took the formula of the first and perfected it. The way the characters
work in combat, how traversing the world works, how building teams works, how
exploration skills work--it's _all_ better in this one. I'm not even a third of
the way through my playthrough, and I already have an itch to start a new
playthrough with the knowledge I have now. I want to make a team with all the
edgelords. I want to make a team with all the sweet cupcakes. I want to hear
what character X has to say about character Y's story.

This game is just dripping with attention to detail. Everywhere I look, there's
something to make me smile or to remind me of some other emotional moment. There
are so many little jokes in items, so many clever little interactions with NPCs.
An example is the "enlightening" accessories, which make your character
_lighter_ (better at dodging). Sure, not the best joke ever, but it made me
smile. Then there are hundreds of other little details like that scattered
everywhere. This game just makes me happy to play.

The art is cute. The music is great. From the moment I booted up the start
screen I knew I was going to like this game.

## 9. Resident Evil 4 (remake)

**Capcom**  
_Adventure/Horror/Action_  
_Survival Horror_

I've been playing more and more of these survival horror games in recent years.
This one was a blast! Never played the original, but I thoroughly enjoyed the
remake. I should probably go back for the other recent remakes, considering how
much I liked this one.

That said, I didn't like it quite as much as other recent Resident Evil games. I
think 3rd person just makes me feel less connected to it all and cheapens pretty
much everything. So this goes beneath both 7 and 8 for me. Really, that says
more about how much I enjoyed 7 and 8 than about this game. Even if I didn't
feel the horror nearly as much, the action was really fun and there were a ton
of amazing set pieces.

## 10. Stray Gods: The Roleplaying Musical

**Summerfall Studios**  
_Adventure/Music_  
_Interactive Fiction_

A wonderful project by a wonderful cast.

This game is, as the name implies, a musical. It reminds me of Telltale style
games. You don't really control a character directly, you just make a bunch of
choices and quicktime events. Interactive fiction seems like a fitting label.

The music is fun. The choices are impactful. The story was good. The
performances were all great. Absolutely stellar cast.

## Honorable Mentions

- **The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom** I was really not a fan of BotW,
  but I enjoyed this one. The changes to the gameplay were great, the dungeons
  felt more dungeon-y, and exploration felt even more rewarding. This one took
  the creative sandbox elements of the first and cranked them to 11. Good stuff.
- **Killer Frequency** Unique horror game. You play as a radio DJ in a town
  which is going through a classic horror movie scenario. You make calls and
  solve puzzles in order to attempt to save as many people as possible through
  nothing but your radio and your listeners' ability to call in to the station.
  It's an interesting change of roles from the usual horror game. It's more of a
  cheesy parody of horror than a real horror game. Very enjoyable.
- **Curse of the Golden Idol: The Spider of Lanka** I loved the base game, so of
  course I'd love the DLC. This is a point-and-click mystery game. You get to
  record clues, narrow down possibilities, and lock in the truth. It reminds me
  of Return of the Obra Dinn, which is some high praise.

## Echoes of the Past

This is a list of games I played in 2023 that made it onto my [Top 25](https://www.backloggd.com/u/Drowrin/list/top-25/), but released in 2022 or earlier. They are ordered by my personal ranking of each game.

- **Signalis** Amazing old school survival horror game that fuses many of my
  favorite kinds of horror at once. If I had played this in the year it came
  out, it would be high on the list.
- **Control** Once again, if I played this when it came out, it would be high on
  the list. Control is an excellent game and I enjoyed every second of it.
- **13 Sentinels** I finally got a Playstation setup I liked well enough to
  finally play this. Honestly, I wasn't a huge fan of the combat, but it was
  well done. Just not my cup of tea. Thankfully, the story was right up my
  alley.
- **Who's Lila?** _Crazy_ experimental psychological horror game. If you play
  this one, go in as blind as you can. It's cheap, short, and very very worth
  it. I've never played anything like this, and I think it legit made me feel
  _horror_ more than any other game.

## Notable Backlog

I know I'll love these. I just need more time! Unfortunately I didn't get them
in by the end of year cutoff, but I'll be getting to these as soon as I can.

- **Lies of P**
- **Sea of Stars**
- **Baldur's Gate 3**

# Manga

![I've read a decent chunk of manga. Unfortunately it's tricky for me to track down exactly how much of these stats came from 2023, but I'd estimate about 1/5th of the chapter/volume count.](/img/mangastats.png)

I am reading plenty of manga that have started recently, but I don't love a ton
of them. If I made a list of only stuff from this year, it would be kinda
pitiful. Additionally, the manga I love the most all took more than a year to
gain momentum and really feel like they deserve a spot on this list. So I think
release year is the wrong qualifier. Instead, I made a list of the top 10 things
I read in 2023, regardless of release year.

## 1. Choujin X

**Sui Ishida**  
_Action/Drama/Fantasy/Psychological_  
_Series_

Years ago, Tokyo Ghoul was my favorite manga. After it wrapped up, and I read
more manga, other series took its place.

Now, Ishida drops Choujin X, and Ishida once again holds top spot for my
favorite manga.

This manga has incredible art, really well written characters, and amazing
combat. All of that in a really cool world with interesting rules. I'm super
excited to see where this goes, and I always love seeing a new chapter show up.

## 2. Sayonara Eri

**Tatsuki Fujimoto**  
_Drama/Psychological_  
_Oneshot_

Fujimoto's best work, and the best oneshot manga I've read. This is a very
satisfying story in a very small package. It's very clever, and a masterful use
of the medium. Give it a look, and go in blind!

## 3. Dandadan

**Yukinobu Tatsu**  
_Action/Comedy/Drama/Romance/Sci-Fi/Supernatural_  
_Series_

This. Manga. Has. Everything.

Action! Sci-fi! Fantasy! Supernatural! Drama! Comedy! Romance! Mystery!

...and somehow it still feels cohesive. It's a wild and crazy story on the
surface, but the core remains solid.

When new chapters show up for multiple series at a time, I will always read this
first.

I am a newly minted huge fan of Yukinobu Tatsu. This manga is S++ tier. It's
filled with gorgeous double page spreads everywhere. The pacing is perfect.
There have been some scenes I get goosebumps just thinking about.

Couldn't be more excited for the anime adaptation.

## 4. One Piece

**Eiichirou Oda**  
_Action/Adventure/Comedy/Fantasy_  
_Series_

The GOAT. ~~pay no attention to the #4 ranking~~

Not many stories can remain this captivating for this long. One piece is always
whimsical, heartfelt, and fun. I can always count on it to be a great read. The
current arc is really, really good too! I'm glad I got caught up in time to read
episodes as they come out leading up to the end of this legend.

## 5. Chainsaw Man

**Tatsuki Fujimoto**  
_Action/Comedy/Drama/Horror/Supernatural_  
_Series_

I feel like I don't need too many notes on this one. Chainsaw Man has been hyped
up enough.

I'll use this space to say that the manga and anime are both excellent in
different ways. The manga is more pulpy and comedy oriented. The anime is more
cinematic.

The recent arc has gone through a little bit of a rough patch, but it's really
starting to pick back up lately. Very excited for more!

## 6. Vagabond

**Takehiko Inoue**  
_Action/Adventure/Drama_  
_Series_

This had been on my backlog for a long time.

This story takes quite a journey. It's all about character development. By the
end, the main character feels like a completely different person, but you can
see the line connecting them throughout the whole story. It's extremely well
written and the art is gorgeous.

I love a slow burn, and that's what this is. If you want a faster paced
experience, this probably won't satisfy you--but if you're willing to invest
time in this, it really pays off.

Unfortunately, it's on indefinite hiatus. I hope we get more someday!

## 7. Monster

**Naoki Urasawa**  
_Drama/Psychological/Thriller/Mystery_  
_Series_

I loved the twists and turns of this--it's is my favorite suspense/thriller
manga.

I need to read more of Naoki Urasawa's work!

I do think the mystery elements aren't quite as strong as they could be, but I
enjoyed the tension regardless. I found the characters really enjoyable as well.

I think my reading habits helped me enjoy this one. I tend to read in small
bursts of a few chapters. So I naturally left myself on cliffhangers repeatedly,
and sat on those cliffhangers until I could read again. So I spent plenty of
time letting that suspense cook in the back of my head, and then I was always
satisfied with the payoff.

## 8. Jujutsu Kaisen

**Gege Akutami**  
_Action/Drama/Supernatural_  
_Series_

I waited way too long to get on this train. The internet meme train spoiled me
on all the things. That's fine though, I still really enjoyed it.

Right now I'm really enjoying theorizing about where this is all leading. It
feels like the kind of manga to leave hints everywhere and then let them pay off
later.

Much like Chainsaw Man though, this probably doesn't need much hyping up. If you
like combat focused manga on the darker side, you'll enjoy it.

## 9. Ghost Reaper Girl

**Akihisa Ikeda**  
_Action/Supernatural_  
_Series_

Very glad this was recommended to me. After the first couple chapters, I didn't
think I'd love this, but I'm glad I stayed with it. After gaining a little
momentum, everything has been enjoyable. I just with there was more!

The art is good. The characters are fun. The plot already feels like it is going
wild places despite the small chapter count.

I may also be biased by my current hyperfixation on the Cthulhu Mythos.

## 10. Vinland Saga

**Makoto Tukimura**  
_Action/Adventure/Drama_  
_Series_

Loved all of this! Loved how it started, and loved how it evolved.

It probably helps that I was on a viking kick when I started.

The characters are fun, even if most of them aren't that deep. I really like all
the drama involved in Thorfinn attempting to accomplish his dream.

In some ways, this reminds me of a shounen take on Vagabond--and I'm begging for
more chapters of both of them!

## Honorable Mentions

- **Undead Unluck** This manga is based. I love the concepts and how clever it
  is. It does sometimes get a little too heavy on explanation and info dumps.
  Otherwise it would have possibly made the list. Still, very enjoyable! It
  reminds me of a fresh take on JoJo-like concepts mixed with a bit of batshit
  insanity (in a good way).
- **Gokurakugai** So far loving every chapter of this. Unfortunately, it's still
  a bit short to feel like it deserves a spot on the list.
- **Houseki no Kuni** Loved this earlier on, but I feel like it should have
  ended a while ago. The author just keeps dragging it on past what would have
  been an ending, and it keeps deteriorating more and more. It's a rotting
  corpse of a beautiful manga. Who knows though, this all could be leading to
  something, and might all be worth it, surely, totally, definitely. That's why
  I keep reading and going more and more insane.

## Echoes of the Past

Didn't actually read these in 2023, but I never made a similar list for earlier
years. Wanted a place for a few standouts despite the rules.

- **JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: JoJolion** This is my favorite JoJo part, but I
  read it in 2022!
- **Jigokuraku** I thoroughly enjoyed this, but again, in 2022. Unfortunately, I
  feel like the anime adaptation hasn't really done it justice. The pacing as
  the anime has gone on has basically fallen apart (especially in combat), but I
  didn't feel that way wile reading it. If you like the concept, I recommend
  just reading it instead. Though that may change in future seasons.
- **Fire Punch** I honestly like Fire Punch even more than Chainsaw Man, but I
  read it in 2022.
