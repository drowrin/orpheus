# Gameplay

Gameplay was _great_. One of the most fun action games I've played in recent
memory. Definitely the most fun this year so far.

I'm a sucker for rapid strings of timed parries. I've been in love with that
since I picked up Sekiro. I loved it in Lies of P, I loved it in this. **I'll
always love that style of gameplay**.

Offense felt really dynamic too. There are a lot of nicely balanced moving
parts. There are multiple energy meters that recharge in different ways to fuel
different abilities, consumable items that open up a lot of options, and a ton
of combos that are good in different situations and occasionally interact with
the energy systems. I never felt bored in combat, _even against the most basic
enemies._

I was pleasantly surprised by the ||survival horror|| sections. They took two
genres that are among my favorites recently and put _both_ in this game.

# Music

Music was great. Especially the stuff that was obviously Keiichi Okabe. I wasn't
as big a fan of the other ~2/3 of the music (especially the more nasally pop
stuff), but none of it was bad. It did kinda feel like the music lacked
cohesion--with multiple competing styles which made the tracks I liked less
stand out even more.

Boss tracks were all _great_ regardless.

# Environments and Setpieces

Incredible. I really liked the variety this game had. _especially_ towards the
end. It started on the bland, brown-and-grey side, but managed to avoid looking
muddy and lifeless due to this. Then as the game went on, the environments
got more and more bold. It felt like the environment design mirrored the
intensity of the story.

Some of the individual setpieces within the environments were _really killer_
though. Everything after the point of no return is just flawless. I especially
loved ||**FIRING A RAILGUN AT A MILE-WIDE MONSTER USING MY HEALTH AS AMMO WHILE
DRIFTING INTO SPACE.** _hell. yes._||

# Story

The story and pacing is what really held it back for me. It felt to me like the
structure was really shallow and contrived, and so much of what we were doing
_just didn't really matter_. Lots of stuff that felt like filler to me. Almost
every character lacked personality except Lily, and even she was just "increase
cheeriness by 50%". I was also disappointed by how many side characters were
just lifeless copypasted clones of each other, all in that same heavily
obscuring armor--but that's not a dealbreaker on its own. Part of me wants to
think ||this was all intentional|| but even if it was, I don't think it was
worth it.

The main character designs were cool though. Especially some of the recurring
characters outside of the main trio (though they were decent too). Characters
like Orcal, Enya, and Mann had _killer_ designs.

I looked online to see if NG+ ||changes dialogue stuff and lets you
"understand" Naytiba|| but it doesn't. Major missed opportunity there, imo.
Especially with how much this game tried to be NieR. Not that it's required
to do that. It just would have been _really_ cool and would have only cost
paying for some more writing and voice acting.

That said, the vibes were great. Cool setpieces, awesome visuals, and well-done
action shots. The game tried to be NieR and Evangelion at the same time, and
even if it didn't achieve the same depth, **it certainly nailed the vibes**.
