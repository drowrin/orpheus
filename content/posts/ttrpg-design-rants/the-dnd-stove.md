I'll preface this by saying: I love Brennan Lee Mulligan. He's
entertaining and has a ton of talent for storytelling.

This quote is from _Fireside Chat for Chapter 2_, with editorial brackets from
Charlie Hall's
[article](https://www.polygon.com/24105875/worlds-beyond-number-narrative-style-adventure).
It has generated a ton of discourse online over the past few days. It's got me
feeling like sharing my thoughts, even though I recognize nobody asked.

To me, the "D&D Stove" has too many buttons, too many knobs, and has a hand
crank on the side that you must crank at exactly the correct rate. It doesn't
"do that for me", it asks for a significant effort from the players and GM in
order to make that part of the game work. That effort can be fun, but having
more detailed combat rules certainly doesn't make combat easier or more
automatic.

# The Part I Like

> I take care of emotions, relationships, character progression, because that
> shit is intuitive and I understand it well.

Brennan and his players clearly love the simple d20+skill modifier system. It
gets out of the way, it's simple, it's fast. It lets them focus on the
roleplaying, as he describes in the quote. Hell, one of his recent series went
like a year without any combat, or something like that? Just pure skill checks
and roleplaying for a long campaign. Honestly, sounds great to me. There are
many games designed for that kind of play, and most of them would get out of
their way even more, without having to worry about class selection or levels, or
whatever.

# The Part I Take Issue With

You only _need_ a game to do that for you if you want to tell a combat story.

Brennan's claim is that D&D is not a combat-oriented game, and then justifies
it by saying _you need it for all the combat you'll definitely be doing_.

I'll take that step further and say that _even when you want to tell a combat
story_, you still don't **actually need this**. The only time you actually
need a game to do this is when you _want to play the combat minigame_.

You could just as easily handle entire combat situations in a few skill rolls,
if you like the skill system. I've played games like that and preferred that way
of handling things massively. Instead, D&D (and many games like it) takes an
opposite approach and _focuses on the details_ in those situations. You don't
need to intuitively understand how an arrow flies through space for D&D, but you
_do_ need to know that it has a 60ft range, might have a cover bonus, compare
the roll against AC, check reactions, etc. In a more narrative game, you can get
all those pesky details out of the way and focus on the drama and tension of the
scene you are framing around that arrow being fired. Do we really care if
Legolas swinging up onto an Oliphant to fire a handful of arrows into the back
of it's skull made intuitive, physical sense, and followed a set of "balanced"
boardgame rules? Or do we care that it was a badass scene? If you prefer the
latter, D&D exclusively gets in the way. If you prefer the former, that's also
valid, but pretending D&D is not a combat-focused game is just silly.

# Rules Elide, The Eternal Discourse

I saw a lot of other discourse around the idea that "Rules Elide", an idea I do
think has some merit, but gets misapplied in these discussions. The idea being,
in short (paraphrased from a much better written, much longer article, which
I can sadly no longer find online):

> Imagine a lockpicking scene. The GM describes each pin being shifted into
> place, simulating in her mind where each one is, and reacting based on where
> exactly the lockpicking character's player describes placing their tools.
> Maybe the GM actually understands this process, or maybe they have a
> misunderstanding about lock mechanics. They go back and forth over this, until
> eventually the player solves the puzzle that exists only in the GM's head, or
> gives up.
>
> This conversation can be elided by a rule that lockpicking is handled with a
> skill check, coin flip, whatever. The point is, it skips over the tedium that
> the players and GM have agreed is not something they want to engage in, and
> focuses on the results: Did the lock open? How long did it take? Were there
> any mishaps such as broken tools?

This suggests that all rules in these games inherently hide away and abstract
some detailed simulation that the GM and players do not want to work with. (I
think this can be true, but isn't always)

People then take this argument as support that _D&D doesn't focus on combat, it
elides it_.

What?

Tactical combat games do the exact opposite. In the above example, the single
lockpicking roll abstracts away all the detail. It compacts that paragraph into
a sentence. Tactical combat does the opposite. It inserts a "(roll for this)" 3
times into each sentence. It's like the GM asking the player to work through the
lock one tumbler at a time--like the first example--but asking for an accuracy
roll to find the pin, a force roll to check if they got the pin secured, checks
for trapped/trick pins, and so on.

I think "Rules Elide" can be a great philosophy for game design, but it's not an
argument that all games were already designed with it in mind. In many games,
rules expand.

# Conclusion

If Brennan Lee Mulligan actually wants a "TTRPG Stove" he brings the food to,
he'd be better served by something that _actually_ elides combat. Instead, he
runs another show that is structurally designed to have a 50/50 ratio of big
combat setpieces and roleplaying time. It's clear that he just likes the combat
rules, and that's fine and extremely valid. Just weird to hear him claim the
opposite, lol. I saw someone comment, "If D&D is a stove, you've been describing
baking" and I think that's accurate. Either Brennan should try an oven, or he
just really likes cooking but enjoys the thought of baking.
