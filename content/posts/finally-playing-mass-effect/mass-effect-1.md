In my quest to tackle my backlog, I've finally hit the Mass Effect series. It's
been on my list for a long, long time. I've tried to get into it several times,
but each time I ended up bouncing off. With the Legendary Edition out, it's in
the best state it has even been. So it seems like a great point to start.

Overall thoughts: The latter half of the game was way, way better than the
start. Very enjoyable by the end. Glad I stuck with it past the parts that
deterred me previously.

# Story

I like what the story was cooking, and what it is setting up for the other
games. There were a couple things I'd consider possible plot holes ||mostly
considering evidence and trust. Felt like pretty much anything considered
evidence was extremely flimsy, and trust was given before I earned it and then
denied after I earned it. Inconsistent|| but it didn't detract from the overall
plot too much. Every time the plot "opened up" with a big reveal was very
nicely handled. Love, love, loved all the lore dumps at various points. I loved
how ||eldritch horror|| the ||Reapers|| felt. I loved the pressure of the
missions always being a race to catch up to ||Saren||.

# Gameplay

Combat and Mako sections were... okay. I think I'm right down the middle on
this. I didn't dislike the cover shooter aspects, and I can forgive weak gunplay
and poor AI quality due to the age of the game. Was kinda annoyed by the ability
system and tactical mode (or whatever it's called). Not only were abilities very
inconsistent to aim, they had pretty long cooldowns even when maxed out. I
didn't pick Adept to hit 1-2 ability buttons per minute and spam only pistols
the rest of the time. Grenades also sucked ass. AI would also occasionally
decide to make choices that had no counterplay at all, and I'd just die without
a chance to defend myself at all. Mako was just kinda boring, but at least not
negative. That said, both combat and Mako elements were not _too_ annoying. They
were carried hard by their environments, which were very cool and definitely
made up for it.

# Music

Great. No notes.

# Frustrations With the Dialogue System

Jeez. I'm struggling to think of a dialogue system I disliked more than this.
The morality system is godawful and legitimately some of the worst narrative
design I think I've ever seen. Sorry, if you want to express any of these
character traits regularly:

- pragmatic
- intimidating
- hotblooded
- cocky
- unwilling to take shit

You've first gotta be massively racist 17 times and commit 5 war crimes
(hyperbole, of course, but that's what it felt like).

Even weirder, it's very inconsistent. _Sometimes_ the pragmatic option was the
Paragon choice, even though it generally felt like it should have been the
Renegade option. It was like they couldn't come up with a good Paragon option
for a situation, just yoinked Renegade's shit, and then made Renegade the
dumbest-wall-of-bricks, comically-evil-for-no-reason option to compensate and
make it the "less good" option.

It's wild to me that you could literally rip the Paragon/Renegade system out of
the game entirely, and not only would nothing of value be lost--the game would
massively improve for it. It's **exclusively** a hindrance to the game with not
a single upside I could find. It's _so close_ to being one of my favorite RPGs
ever from the choices you could make, but that one system locks otherwise
near-perfection away. I think that's why I find it so frustrating. It
legitimately may be my single most hated mechanic in any game I've played.

# Rating

All that complaining aside, I still really enjoyed the game, mostly thanks to
the worldbuilding, art style, music, and story. I generally don't like
lasers-and-shields scifi, so it was fighting an uphill battle from the start,
but it managed to absolutely win me over regardless. It's a testament to how
cool this story is that it managed to really get me hooked even through all the
things I disliked about the game it was wrapped in.

Overall 8/10, very good. Excited to check out the later games in the series.
Gonna start right away!
