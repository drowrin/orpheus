What a year! I can think of years that had games I loved more. I can think of
years that had more total games I engaged with. However, in no other year was it
this difficult to narrow down my top 10 list.

In past years, I have included podcast and music sections. However, this year I
was busy with games! I listened to gaming podcasts. I listened to game
soundtracks. I'm not sure I'd have enough content for either of those sections
to do even top 3 lists. So I'm leaving them out.

Instead, it's all about the games this year---I'm going to need the space!

To put this wild year into perspective, here are some stats:
- 14% of the 10/10 ratings I've ever given out released this year.
- 19% of the 9/10 ratings I've ever given out released this year.
- 4 games released this year are currently in my top 10 of all time.
- Here's a chart of the 10s and 9s I've given out over the last decade:

<LineGraph
  data={[
    { x: 2015, '10s': 1, '9s': 1, },
    { x: 2016, '10s': 1, '9s': 0, },
    { x: 2017, '10s': 1, '9s': 1, },
    { x: 2018, '10s': 0, '9s': 1, },
    { x: 2019, '10s': 3, '9s': 3, },
    { x: 2020, '10s': 0, '9s': 2, },
    { x: 2021, '10s': 2, '9s': 1, },
    { x: 2022, '10s': 1, '9s': 3, },
    { x: 2023, '10s': 2, '9s': 2, },
    { x: 2024, '10s': 2, '9s': 5, },
    { x: 2025, '10s': 4, '9s': 8, },
  ]}
  colors={{
    '10s': 'var(--color-red)',
    '9s': 'var(--color-blue)',
  }}
  padding={{ top: 0 }}
/>

I think these stats are more meaningful than average scores for each year. Some
years, I just play a lot of mediocre games---but the masterpieces are what stand
out when I look back. When I reflect on the games of 2025 in the future, a _lot_
of games are going to stand out.

I tried normalizing this chart over total games played each year, and it hardly
changed. That number hasn't meaningfully differed.

There were just _way too many good games_ this year.

---

Every year, I've made upgrades to the way I publish these notes. I've come a
long way from writing long posts in OneNote and dumping them in Discord as
multiple messages.

There's some scuffed paint here and there, but I think that just makes it feel
human. Tinkering with this thing has been as much of a hobby for me as filling
it with content. I hope you enjoy!

# Notable Backlog

So many good games released this year. I simply could not get to them all---and
I tried. I played _34_ new releases in 2025. A lot of those were very short, and
that's why they made the cut. However, even the short games on this backlog
could no longer fit by the end of the year. I do hope to get to them someday!

In addition to this list, a few good remakes came out this year for games I
already had on my backlog. I will play the remakes instead of the original
versions, when I get to those. But this post is already long enough, so I'm not
going to include remakes in the backlog section.

There were a few other games I've technically added to the ever-growing backlog.
Over a dozen! It would take far too long to list them all out in detail. For
this section I'm focusing on the games I'm most excited about. Those games are
_weak maybes_, these are the **strong maybes**.

## Look Outside

This is a horror RPG made in RPG Maker. That combination is pretty popular, but
a game like it has never managed to grab me. I think the intentionally slow and
basic turn-based combat with long pauses and descriptive text is just a little
too indulgent for me. However, it's a subgenre I think I could get into, given
the right game.

This game has a chance at that.

What makes this one different? From the few hours I played, I gathered that
everything within it is a metaphor for _social anxiety_ (something I struggle
with). It could evolve past that, or my read of it might change given more
context, but I'm already on board.

Unfortunately, I ended up bouncing off of it. It's the kind of horror game that
attempts to make the player feel some frustration, confusion, and stress. I need
to be in the right mood for that. So I'll give it another shot when I need a
horror game.

## Routine

Routine is a first-person sci-fi horror game. As far as I can tell without
having played it, it's the "unstoppable pursuer" type of horror. That stuff
_really_ gets to me. I've also heard that the sound design is amazing.

This was on my radar. Then it came out and I ignored it. I was busy and looking
for games to cut from my list. This just didn't make it in. Then I watched some
GotY podcasts at the end of the year, and saw it show up in several top 10
lists. Now it's back on my radar.

Like above, I'm saving this one for an empty weekend in need of a good dose of
horror. Could be a fun October pick. We'll see!

## Octopath Traveler 0

It almost feels unfair to put this here, because I'm saving it for a full
Octopath series retrospective---but it _did_ come out this year, and I **did
not** play it.

I've heard many people pour out their hearts for this game. I've heard at least
one person name it as their **Game of the Year**, even surpassing the _obvious_
JRPG option. I think if I _had_ played it this year, it would have had similar
impact on me.

Also, the story behind the development of this game is just so cool. This is a
recreation of a mobile gacha game. The community has long ensured the rest of
the fanbase that the story was fantastic, but many people (including me!)
rejected it based on format alone. Now, it has been released as a **full**
console/PC RPG. It's not just the same game with gacha mechanics stripped out,
leaving obvious holes in the game design. No, it's been rebuilt from the ground
up as an all-new game that stands as a proud mainline entry in the series.

I hope this becomes a pattern with other gacha games.

## Rhythm Doctor

This released near the end of the year, and I already had one big rhythm game on
my plate. I simply didn't have room. I really do want to get to this at some
point though. I've played the early access content when that first became
available, and I returned for several early access updates as more content was
released. I've been excited for it for a while, but somehow I didn't end up
hearing about the release date until it was already out. That certainly didn't
help.

This is a _very_ charming and creative rhythm game. It's got a solid gimmick:
you only have one button, and you press it on the 7th beat. Sounds boring. The
term one-note sounds made for this. But it's not. The variety comes from
changing up the rhythms themselves. Beats are skipped, syncopated, and
overlapped. Sometimes this game asks you to get good with polyrhythms, and then
stacks all of its other tricks on top. Sometimes it will pull out wild time
signatures to mess with you and make everything sound out of control and
impossible... but suddenly it all clicks into place.

I'm told this is a drummers' game. I wouldn't know, but I believe it.

The story and presentation are also cute. The game is about a hospital, and the
patients have various heart rhythm problems. That's where all the interesting
rhythm challenges come from. I love the art style, and I remember being
surprisingly interested in the narrative when I played the initial early access
content.

Like I said though, another rhythm game currently has _my_ heart in its grip. So
it might be a while until I get to this one, but I'm very happy it successfully
launched.

# Miscellaneous Awards

Some of these games absolutely deserved a shout out, but my Honorable Mentions
and Top 10 list are already too long. This section is for the games that I think
deserve at least one award, but the overall package didn't land with me well
enough for them to end up in the other sections.

This year was so crazy that even games that I think ended up best-in-category
didn't even make it into the Honorable Mentions.

Though I'll also admit that not all of these awards are strictly positive.

## Silent Hill f

**Rating: 7/10**  
_Playtime: 10 hours_

This has some of the gnarliest scenes I've seen in a game in a long time. It's
absolutely raw in the best way. Hinako's actress, Konatsu Kato, put on a
phenomenal performance that I don't think she has gotten enough credit for. The
visuals are also stunning. It absolutely runs away with Best Horror for me this
year.

Unfortunately, I wasn't a huge fan of the game's structure. I have completed
only the first playthrough and a couple hours of a second. I know it gets much,
much better as you dig deeper on repeats, but I just can't do it. I was already
not enjoying the gameplay, and I _very rarely_ can stand replaying **any** game.
Going through segments I had already played through was just too much to ask.

Still, I enjoyed that first playthrough. The story was worth it, and I'm
honestly pretty content with the first ending by itself.

## The First Berserker: Khazan

**Rating: 8/10**  
_Playtime: 40 hours_

This could have taken Best Combat and a place on the top 10 most other years.

Khazan's story is... fine. Not great. But the aesthetic is pretty fantastic, and
the high-magic dark fantasy setting lends itself well to spectacle. For a game
like this, where the action is the main draw, that's more than fine with me.

This had some insanely good boss designs. Especially towards the end of the
game. I played pretty close to release, and some of these fights took me
multiple days of attempts. They were worth it every time. The feeling of
satisfaction was _insane_ after each fight.

Where the gameplay fell off for me a bit was side content and grinding. I didn't
care for the gear system. I missed out on the true ending and the true final
boss, but I still had a blast.

## Blue Prince

**Rating: 6/10**  
_Playtime: 15 hours_

This is a game I really _should_ have liked. I **love** investigative puzzle
games in which you dig deep into mysteries and uncover secrets. There's a
particular kind of delight that can only be accessed through games like that,
and they're pretty rare. So I was excited for this one, especially after hearing
all the hype around it.

Unfortunately, I found this an extremely frustrating experience. I like what it
was going for, but the particular fusion of genres didn't work for me. I spent
_so long_ just waiting on RNG to allow me to complete a puzzle after I already
knew the solution. There's _almost_ nothing I hate more than that. Maybe they
could charge me money to solve a puzzle? That would be like, only 10% worse.
It's **that** bad, in my opinion.

I finished the original ending of the game just to say I did it. This would be a
10/10 and probably one of my favorite games of all time if literally all RNG was
deleted. Such a shame.

I want to be very clear though: I don't think this is a _bad_ game. I'm glad it
has fans that love it so passionately. This kind of game _should_ be celebrated.
It just happened to not work out for me personally.

## Split Fiction

**Rating: 8/10**  
_Playtime: 13 hours_

I feel bad starting this with negativity, but I don't like Josef Fares, Director
of Hazelight Studios. I think his ego is a bit much, and I unfortunately think
that ego slipped into this game's design more than the previous Hazelight games.
For a game with the supposed ethos of artists fighting against The System™, this
is a very sanitized, corporate, Marvel-ass story. This is a story from a man who
said ["EA is getting more shit than they
deserve"](https://www.thegamebusiness.com/i/184382506/hazelight-and-ea) but
_thinks_ he is still a punk artist fighting the machine.

It's also pretty hilarious for a game about writing to have such terrible
writing.

But cringe story aside, I had a blast with Split Fiction. In fact, if it weren't
for one particular other game that released this year, I think it would have
taken my "Best Action" award. It's a phenomenal co-op experience that is
executed as flawlessly as I can imagine. My only gameplay complaint is that a
few levels overstay their welcome a few rooms longer than needed, but that's
only a minor issue.

In particular, this game's final level left me absolutely dumbfounded. That was
stuff I've never seen in a videogame before. Stuff that I didn't really even
think about being _possible_ in a videogame. Absolutely inspirational. That
level is what gave this game the leg up it needed to hit this list despite my
misgivings about other aspects. I had a dumb smile on my face that no other game
this year manage to provoke.

# Honorable Mentions

I'm putting as much detail into my Honorable Mentions this year as I am for the
Top 10 Games. This is because it was agonizing trying to cut the list of games I
**loved** down to just 10. I'm passionate about far too many of them. I need
space to talk about them for more than a single paragraph. I need space to give
them their well deserved flowers.

For a while, I considered expanding my list beyond a top 10. However, I've
decided to do this instead: these honorable mentions are ranked. If I _were_ to
expand the top 10, these are already in the correct order to add.

For a small additional disclaimer, there are a few games I played this year that
I scored higher than some of these honorable mentions. However, I felt these
were more deserving of a shout-out for one reason or another. It's my list and I
can contradict myself if I want to!

## Lies of P: Overture

**Rating: 8/10**  
_Playtime: 16 hours_

I don't love this game as much as my friends do, but I still consider this an
incredible game. I was very excited for this DLC, and it more than delivered.

The opening area is absolutely masterful and will be something I compare other
games in the genre to for a long time. Overture stays pretty strong for the
entire duration, but that area stands out.

The ending is also wildly cool. It ties so many things together from both the
base game and the DLC in a perfectly paced feast of absolute cinema. The final
boss is crazy good. I feel like I keep saying stuff like this too much, but in
any other year this would have been a top contender for Best Boss. It all
expands on characters from the base game in exactly the way it should.

I have nothing bad to say about this. It's one of the most solid game expansions
I've played.

For some reason, I just haven't managed to connect to the stage the game is
played upon. The story and world have just not managed to grip me as much as I
have seen them grip others. So it falls into a similar tier as Khazan for me,
where the action is all superb and the spectacles are very pretty, and that's as
deep as I get on it. To be fair, I'm sure that's a failure on my part to give
the narrative enough effort to engage with it properly. I don't fault the game
for it, but that's why it doesn't rise higher than this on my list.

## The Drifter

**Rating: 8/10**  
_Playtime: 7 hours_

This is a sci-fi thriller point-and-click adventure game. It has quickly risen
to become one of my favorite point-and-click games, though I'll admit to not
having played many.

The voice acting really sold the tension, and is by far the best part of the
game. The story and puzzles are neat. The art is fantastic. The music is
extremely solid. But _man_, the narration by the main character is just so
goddamn good.

My only complaints are those that I typically apply to the genre. Sometimes I
got frustrated trying to figure out the puzzles. Walking back and forth across
half a dozen (or more) screens of content to try and brute force which two items
need to be smashed together isn't super fun for me. I had to look up the
solution once or twice.

I'm hesitant to say much more, because this game is easily spoiled. If you like
pulp horror/thriller stories, I recommend it. Go in blind and let the experience
hit you fresh.

## and Roger

**Rating: 8/10**  
_Playtime: 1 hours_

No longer than it needed to be, and ridiculously dense with emotional impact.
_and Roger_ is a **rich** experience, more than a game. It uses game design
principles to tell a story with very few words. It's Game Design as Art in pure,
efficient form.

If you have a spare hour, I highly recommend it. Go in blind.

You'll notice that I didn't give it a perfect score, and it didn't make it onto
my top 10 list. To talk about that, I'll need to talk about spoilers: ||I was
very much enjoying the opening mystery, but I quickly caught on to the idea it
was going for. It then took the game a significant amount of time to catch up
and "reveal" that information. With a game this short, spending so much time
slow rolling the ideas left a disproportionately large amount of dead
air---almost half the runtime. It's all worth it for the ending though.||

## Ghost of Yotei

**Rating: 8/10**  
_Playtime: 40 hours_

Ghost of Yotei is a stunning game. It rivals the best of the year in terms of
polish and exploration. The visuals are so finely tuned and cinematic that
experiencing this game often feels like watching a movie. The acting is
excellent, especially that of Erika Ishii as the game's protagonist, Atsu.

I love how they blended cowboy and samurai movie tropes and themes. It's got the
classic slow entry into a saloon, during which everyone stops to stare at the
protagonist who is clearly quite bold for showing their face here---but then
it's katanas at high noon. The music plays into this fusion as well, at times
sounding like a western theme played on a shamisen.

What I find even more interesting about fusion of genres is how it plays with
gender. Both cowboy and samurai stories are (in my experience) rooted deeply in
masculinity and the societal expectations of it. I'd go so far as to say that
these genres typically _center themselves around_ lifting up paragons of
masculinity. Ghost of Yotei challenges this.

Atsu is a badass. She is a woman, and I don't think the game treats her
otherwise just to fit her into the masculinity-shaped box that the genre
expects. She faces the challenges of societal expectations of femininity rather
than those of masculinity. She has no presumed strength, she must demonstrate
it. She is _used to_ always having to demonstrate it. This makes her fierce and
uncompromising, but not unfeeling. Her equipment is fierce and practical but has
feminine elements, and isn't designed for the male gaze. I'm no expert on this
subject matter, and maybe my bar is too low, but I was impressed.

Gameplay is also excellent. Combat is a marginal improvement over Ghost of
Tsushima, and that's higher praise than it sounds. Atsu's particular brand of
fighting dirty and taking every advantage she can get is brutally satisfying.
Open world exploration is the smoothest I've ever seen. It just keeps putting
fun content in front of you, all the while delivering beautiful views.

The reason I don't rate it higher is that the plot didn't give me much to chew
on. It's well executed, but mostly a series of tropes strung together. I
predicted every "twist" miles ahead. That's not necessarily a bad thing---all
those story moments were executed well. I just miss the more complex story of
its predecessor.

Ghost of Tsushima let the narrative themes drive the gameplay. Jin Sakai, the
protagonist, has an incredible character arc of slowly giving up his rigid
ideals in order to serve the greater good. This is integrated extremely well
into the gameplay, by making fighting dirty a power fantasy, but one that truly
_feels_ dirty and brutal in the context of the story. By the end, you the player
are fully on board taking every edge you can over these evil, evil bastards,
even as other characters in the story look on in horror.

I was disappointed to see that Ghost of Yotei transferred all of those gameplay
mechanics over without the story weight to back them up. I would have preferred
it come up with its own set of thematically appropriate set of mechanics for
Atsu's journey. It feels like it has done both her and Jin a disservice by not
doing so.

To be clear, I like Atsu as a protagonist more than Jin. I think she is overall
more interesting and better written as a character. I'm just a sicko for
mechanics helping tell the story, and this game had a lot of missed potential on
that front. Especially from a studio that has previously demonstrated their
ability to nail it. This would be a better game if tried to be its own thing
instead of fitting into a franchise.

Still, one of the most fun games of the year, and absolutely a favorite. Also,
Zeni Hajiki wins Best Minigame of the year. "Left Handed Training" also _almost_
deserves an award of its own. There are lots of little fantastic things like
that.

## Dispatch

**Rating: 8/10**  
_Playtime: 8 hours_

I used to _love_ Telltale Games. I know they aren't for everyone, but they're
certainly for me. I'm okay with the illusion of choice as long as that illusion
is well executed. There **is** meaning in giving the player a choice in
particular moments, no matter how much the game actually changes. It's the same
reason I've always been a fan of Quick Time Events. Giving me a gun and making
me shoot that character is always going to be more emotionally impactful for me
than simply watching a character get shot.

However, it can also be done very poorly. If a choice isn't sold well, or feels
like it was added arbitrarily instead of intentionally for impact, it can
actually _harm_ the experience instead. A lot of studios started including such
choices because they thought gamers expected choices, not for artistic reasons.

Telltale were masters at this. Their best releases cleanly avoided those issues
and included only the best of the narrative choice genre's game design space.
Unfortunately, they were restructured, and fell apart. No longer did it feel
like they were producing works of art, but rather corporate slop designed around
their competitors' mistaken interpretations of the genre.

I haven't played a game in the choice-based narrative game genre in years. So
many came out that didn't grab me. I thought that either my tastes were changing
and it was time to leave the genre behind, or the handful of examples I liked
were just miracles never to be repeated. I lost faith in the genre, and started
assuming that all new games within it would fall into the patterns I disliked.

But Telltale is back, under a new name: AdHoc Studio. They're better than ever,
and kicking ass already. They have reassured me that there is still more
potential in this genre, as long as the artists are no longer being crushed by
corporate boots. I'm now considering going back to play all the choice-based
narrative game releases I've missed over the years.

Critical Role swooped in with necessary funds to keep this new studio afloat,
and I'm glad they were the ones to do it. I don't think many other funding
sources would be open to how unhinged this game gets. There's a dick on screen,
played for laughs, in the first 5 minutes---but there are also times when sex
and sexuality are shown in mature, vulnerable, human ways. Not many other
publishers would go for that. Matt Mercer recently said that Critical Role is
all about coming together as friends to create something "weird, wild, and a
little perverted," and that's the kind of energy you can only get from an
artist-owned production. It's rare for that kind of work to actually have money
behind it, and I want more of it.

Look, this isn't a flawless game---but it's damn good. The writing is good _for
what it is_, not some masterpiece. The jokes are funny. The performances and
animations are great. The gameplay is _fine_, but it interacts with the story in
interesting ways.

If you're willing to throw 8 hours at what is essentially the hottest new super
hero cartoon (which doesn't fall into Marvel-isms) since Invincible, give it a
shot!

# Top 10 Games

We've arrived at the fun stuff---the hot take zone. As I've already mentioned,
this was a ridiculously difficult list to narrow down. I have second guessed
myself so many times. I have made wild swings and moved entries around several
places at a time. I've been building this list all year, ranking each game after
finishing it. But the list needed _a lot_ of refinement after that process.

Even as I wrote this section, games continued to move around. I talk about it
like it was agony, but it's why I do this every year. Trying to compare things
and writing out my thoughts on each of them gets me to think far more deeply
about them than I would have otherwise. This process has given me a new
appreciation for these games. Putting effort into appreciating things more is
really what this is all about.

So, here they are---my top 10 games of 2025:

## The Roottrees are Dead

**Rating: 9/10**  
_Playtime: 12 hours_

The Roottrees are Dead is an investigative game about digging up the darkest
secrets of a wealthy family.

It is 1998. The private jet of the Roottree family just crashed, killing the
star sisters and their parents, the heads of one of the largest worldwide candy
empires. When the company was created half a dozen generations ago, legal
documents were signed ensuring that any inheritance based on the company fortune
would be distributed to exclusively blood relatives. It's now your job to figure
out exactly who they are. That's a much, much harder task than it sounds.

The family stretches from wealthy nepo-baby actors to broke college students
whose parents were alienated from the family due to nonconformity to societal
norms. You've gotta track down all the secret children born to maids and
secretaries, all the family members that nobody talks about anymore, and uncover
all the concealed adoptions. The documents are very clear: only blood matters.

It all takes place in one room. You've got a networked computer, an evidence
board, a notebook, and the promise of a large payday if you can untangle this
web. The gameplay is digging through websites, journals, and newspapers,
comparing images, and listening carefully to the lyrics of the songs that one
guy wrote. There's information everywhere, and sometimes just one new clue can
cause ripples across your entire evidence board.

This is a **very** well constructed investigative game. It reminds me of The
Return of the Obra Dinn, and that's some of the highest praise I can offer to a
game in this genre. It doesn't just have clever webs of information to untangle,
it's designed in such a way that every clue you find feels extremely meaningful
and satisfying.

I'll also praise the notebook mechanic. You can copy just about any text in the
game into your notebook, with a reference back to where you found it. Between
that and the evidence board, it feels like you are constantly building a
personal information system of your own design. It's extremely smooth, and I
hope it becomes a standard for the genre going forward.

This game has two even cooler challenges at the end:

||Throughout the game, every text box you've had to fill in would give you a
list of options. For example, if you are trying to match a name to a face, the
text box would give you every name you've encountered that you haven't already
matched with another face. This lets you narrow down the data without having to
remember the hundreds of details in the game. The _final_ challenge is
different. You're asked to fill in a completely freeform box. The name you need
does not appear anywhere else. You need to use other bits of context to fill in
the negative space, like discovering a black hole by the movements of celestial
bodies around it, but for _a name_. It's one of the coolest challenges I've ever
seen in one of these games. Because not only does it take such deep
understanding of the puzzles so far (and is ludicrously satisfying to complete),
it's also a **huge** "oh shit" moment.||

||Then, even crazier, the game _contains its own sequel_. You think you're at
the end, and then the game asks if you're ready for round two. An even bigger
"oh shit" moment. The story behind this part of the game is that the rules of
the inheritance have leaked to the media, and now tons of people are coming
forward as "Secret Roottrees." Now it's your job to find out if any of them are
telling the truth. This requires excellent understanding of all the information
learned in the first part of the game, and now layers on more elements. Adding
to the "oh shit" moment is the immediate scale of the problem. For the first
half of the game, the board slowly expands as you fill it out. This one just
starts with the full, empty board. Wild. It gets better, but I'm going to put
this in _another_ spoiler:||

||The final challenge of this part of the game is that somebody you thought was
on your side was an unreliable source the entire time. They had carefully
manipulated some of the clues you had gotten so that the logic still worked out,
but certain members of the family ended up inside or outside the inheritance as
this person's employers desired. It's a **fucking excellent** final mystery.
This game spends its entire runtime constantly shaking itself up, and then drops
a bomb on everything you thought you knew at the end. But what's really clever
is that this bomb doesn't delete your work---it merely recontextualizes it. As
soon as you figure it out, every other piece on the board snaps into its new
place in your mind. It's a hell of a brain massage.||

This game also nails the tone very well. It's extremely cute that every time you
find new evidence for the board, you hear printer noises in the background. Then
you can go pick up those papers and place them where you want. It's got a nice,
tactile feel to it, which is unique for a game like this. It's also fun that you
can find demo tapes and CDs and stuff to play, and they're actually sometimes
relevant to the mystery.

If you are at all a fan of puzzles or mystery solving, this is a must play.

## Despelote

**Rating: 9/10**  
_Playtime: 2 hours_

Despelote isn't really a game. It uses a game engine. You interface with it
using a controller. You use control sticks to move and look around. It's _sort
of_ **about** a game, but not quite.

Despelote is a memoir. It's about the culture of Ecuador in the early 2000s.
It's a celebration of childhood, dreams, and a nationwide obsession with
_soccer_. It's about being awkward and shy but immediately forming an unspoken
connection with other kids the moment a _soccer ball_ hits your foot. It's about
being told to sit still while your family finishes getting ready for a wedding,
but running out in the rain and mud instead---_to play soccer_. It's about that
wedding being interrupted because a TV was set up on the side... _to play
soccer_.

Importantly, Despelote doesn't tell you or even encourage you to do any of these
things. It just gives you opportunities and lets you opt-in to its experiences.
When your mom tells you to wait here until she gets back. You _could_. **OR**
you could go join those kids kicking a ball around in the corner of the park.
There are times when the game leaves nothing around you but an empty, dreamlike
field and a ball. It _knows_ you will kick it.

Through that confident design, Despelote taps into a childlike impulsiveness
that always lingers in the back of my head, which I have paved over with years
of maturity. The feelings Despelote attempts to evoke are difficult to put into
words---but it doesn't need to. Despelote does not just _express_ these
feelings...

**It invites you to feel them, too.**

I haven't yet talked about the atmosphere of this game. It's extremely
immersive, but not in the way many games are, with a blanket of sound that wraps
around you. It's the way people respond as you walk up to them. It's the
dedicated "¡Hola!" button. It's the way kids include you naturally in the soccer
circle when you approach. It's the _extremely_ natural conversation writing that
sounds less like dialog and more like a recording of a real family conversation.
It's the music.

**Man** the music hits just right.

Despelote is about more than childhood. It's also about what sticks with us as
we change---as the world around us changes.

Upon completing the game, I thought it was _pretty decent_ but nothing amazing.
However, as time passes and I think about it more, I'm realizing exactly how
special that experience was.

The game has more to offer, but I don't want to spoil the experience. If the
above sparked any interest in you, just go play it. You may or may not love it
as much as I do, but I think you'll get a pretty good idea of whether or not
it's up your alley after reading my thoughts.

## Consume Me

**Rating: 9/10**  
_Playtime: 5 hours_

This game is cute. It's a semi-autobiographical story about stress, anxiety, and
disordered eating. It's told through a series of life-sim/management elements
and minigames. To avoid getting too close to the eating disorder topic and
inadvertently causing stress to some viewers, the game uses made up units like
"bites" and "guts," and the scale only displays a thumbs up or thumbs down.

This game was surprisingly nostalgic. I grew up with two sisters (and a third
joined the family once I had already moved out). When we were kids, the
videogames available to us were whatever our parents would get us as gifts. I
got the boy games. They got the girl games. But I didn't have a brother back
then, and my friends weren't always nearby. So I spent most of my time playing
girl games with my sisters.

Girl games were weird back then. For some reason, consoles were for boys, but
girls often got complete, self-contained units that played a single game. A
little round baseball-sized thing with a power cord to the wall and Composite
A/V cables to the TV. I don't remember the name of the one they played the most
often, but it was a life sim. You'd choose what outfits to wear each day, which
would alter your stats, and then you'd choose how to spend your time. You could
study for an upcoming test, but your friends were all going to the mall to hang
out---and Brad's gonna be there. Better wear something cute.

My sisters played that game over and over again. _I_ played that game over and
over again. I vividly remember playing monster hunter on the side, but being too
distracted by the silly little life sim and getting distracted. Who cares about
gender. That looks interesting. I think in some way, that game is also
responsible for the love of roleplaying games I have today. Maybe it's the other
way around.

Anyways, Consume Me reminded me of that old game the moment I opened the demo.
The sound effects, the music, the skills, the meters, and of course, the way you
choose outfits and decide how to spend your day. I wouldn't be surprised if
Jenny Jiao Hsia, the autobiographical subject, played that game or one like it.
I've heard it talked about on the Pew Pew Bang podcast, so I don't think it was
super niche.

The main difference is that instead of being a purely choice-based game, Consume
Me is full of minigames. You can't spend 5 seconds in game without being asked
to click something, or scrub something with your mouse, or drag the watering can
over to the plants, or repeatedly click to keep your eyes on the book. I liked
these. They added some much-needed variety to the game, and they were actually
pretty fun. Also, each one has enough skill expression that you can feel
yourself getting better.

I was impressed with how each minigame uniquely represented the specific kinds
of willpower needed to overcome each everyday challenge. It's hard to stay
focused on schoolwork, so you have to fight to maintain that focus while dodging
distractions. It's tiring, and that's the point. Not only does your character
need a break because her stress meter is too high, you need a break because your
hands are tired. So you settle down and do some chill activity as a reward. It's
effective.

Consume Me is full of (often self-deprecating) humor despite the heavy topics. I
think you'll get the vibe best if you watch the 1-minute trailer:

https://youtu.be/vuoo_zhsAhs

Despite that humor, it's a legitimately stressful game. Managing life while
struggling mentally is _hard_ and the game doesn't downplay that at all. A lot
of people found this game very relatable for various reasons. I'm one of them.
It's an extremely personal game, sometimes on the edge of being too personal.
That makes it easy to connect with this game and its creators on a human level.

Something that sparked a bit of controversy was this game's approach to
religion. I didn't expect that element at all, going into it, but I found the
experience relatable on a personal level. I had a very similar experience in
college. I won't spoil it, but I'm sure you can find it if you're curious and
don't want to play the game (though I highly recommend playing it).

Finally, I applaud the ending. It's certainly unconventional, and not everybody
is going to like that. In fact, that's the most often repeated criticism I've
heard. It somehow hit just right for me. So I'm very happy with this game.
Looking forward to more from Hexecutable in the future.

## Death Stranding 2: On The Beach

**Rating: 9/10**  
_Playtime: 65 hours_

Back in 2019, I fell in love with Death Stranding. This was a relatively
controversial thing to do.

A lot of Kojima fans were expecting something very different, and got mad at
this game for not being Metal Gear Solid VI. It's valid to not enjoy Death
Stranding, of course. I do not claim that _every_ fan disliked it for that
reason, but I don't think it would have been nearly as much of a **discourse**
without a fanbase who wanted this to be something entirely different, and I
don't think that's fair to the game.

Still, the game had a following, and that following grew. It took some people a
few years and a second look to come around on the game. Distance from those
early, misplaced expectations allowed more and more fans to see the game for
what it really was, instead of what it wasn't. The internet also loves to form
hate bandwagons at the first sign of a flaw, even if that flaw was only in their
perception. Memes die, and once it was no longer cool to treat the game as a
punchline, fewer players felt pressured to not even give it a shot.

When I saw the first teaser for Death Stranding 2, I was more excited for it
than any other game in recent memory. Very few games have made me feel like
Death Stranding did. Its use of intentional friction in the gameplay to help
tell a story, its use of music and vistas to inspire contemplation, and the
wordless social system that was so brilliant, were all some of my favorite game
design elements in years. I couldn't wait to see how that could be iterated on.
Now that game is here.

Death Stranding 2 takes a few steps forward, and a few back. It's a much more
"gamey" game than its predecessor. Surprisingly, that's the part I like a bit
less. It feels like a compromise on the original vision. Instead of violence
having consequences and engagements being tense and tough to justify, you're
handed a non-lethal grenade launcher and told to go commit a crime. Instead of
feeling terror when a supernatural Beached Thing creeps up on you from the
afterlife, you feel only mild annoyance at having to stop and do a couple
stealth takedowns. Instead of needing to be very mindful of the environment on
your long contemplative walks, you just throw the cargo into the back of a truck
and put the pedal to the metal. The truck has guns on it, too. Why not? Wanna
take some laps around the supernatural cyberpunk death race while you're here?

On top of that, I wasn't nearly as inspired by the views for _most_ of this
game. The first game consistently felt otherworldly, but also maintained enough
of a grounded feeling that it ended up balancing perfectly on a surreal
tightrope. There are a few very interesting locations that stand out, but they
feel like exceptions that prove the rule. There are a lot more wide open areas
with gradual slopes, boring deserts, and samey environments.

One other negative note: you've got an ever-present companion who constantly
nags you about game mechanics. I'm never a fan of that.

The rest is just as good as the first, if not better. The story beats are
crazier than ever. The performances and cutscene direction are incredible. The
soundtrack is perfect. The game is stunningly beautiful---certainly one of the
best I've ever seen, and it manages that without a single frame drop or
graphical hitch or glitch of any kind over my 65 hour playthrough. The cast of
characters has been developed in fantastic ways, and the new additions are
great.

Where this game really stands above the original is the final third of the
story. Some people have called that particular story arc Kojima's best work. I
haven't (yet) experienced enough of his body of work to make that call myself,
but I certainly find it believable.

Considering both games with all their relative strengths and weaknesses, I
consider this an equal game to the original, not a massive upgrade. A lot of
people consider this a "fixed" version of Death Stranding's "broken" gameplay,
but I have the opposite opinion. Still, the story caries, and I'll be thinking
about this one for a long time.

If you are at all a fan of "Kojima bullshit," I think you'll _adore_ the way
this story unfolds. Whether or not the gameplay speaks to you is another story,
but I still recommend this game with my whole chest.

I'm looking forward to the movie.

## of the Devil

**Rating: 9/10**  
_Playtime: 20 hours (so far)_

It's my list and I'll cheat if I want to.

This game isn't _totally_ out yet. It is being released in episodes, and only
two of the planned five are available at the time of writing. I plan to include
this game as a **real** entry in the future when I have the complete story to
look back on. So I don't want to double dip and have it take a spot on this
year's list. I could break the individual episodes out, but working _around_ the
rules feels on theme for the game.

It's amazing. If I had to rank it based on only the current content, it would
take 7th place---in a _very_ competitive year. Not bad for a visual novel.

I'm a Danganronpa sicko. I have been since it poisoned my brain nearly 15 years
ago. It's a unique blend of investigative game and visual novel. Well, really
the investigative part is all smoke and mirrors, but I love a good magic trick.
I'm told I should really get into the Ace Attorney series. It's on the backlog.
From what I've seen of Ace Attorney, though, it appears to me that this game
draws a delightful amount of inspiration from both series. Like those games,
this alternates between evidence collection point-and-click phases and courtroom
phases. Right down to specific visual motifs and mechanics, this game wears its
inspirations on its sleeve. But it's also it's own, _wonderfully_ twisted thing.

You play as a Defense Attorney in a high-surveillance cyberpunk world. When
every gun phones home whenever it **moves** and every _toaster_ is
live-streaming its surroundings directly into law enforcement databases, crimes
tend to get solved pretty quickly. Defense Attorneys are mostly there for
ceremony, to go through the motions on open-and-shut cases. But this would not
be a terribly good game if those were the kind of cases you dealt with. No, only
the _weirdest_ cases are interesting in this world, and your character has a
reputation for winning interesting cases. Since the world doesn't allow for
boring answers, you can be confident that every question will be juicy.

On top of all the wonderful cybernoir writing, this game is so stylish that it
deserves an award. Perhaps in the year it fully releases, it'll get one. Poker
and other similar card games form the aesthetic basis for most mechanics. You
play evidence like cards. It's blackjack when you're trying to question a
witness without them saying something that works against you. Debates are
handled with previously established evidence as the flop and your arguments as
your hand. You even throw cards at people to counter their statements. Of
course, it's not actually a game of random cards. You're given exactly the cards
that move the story forward, whether those are good for you or not. Still, the
aesthetic does a great job of contributing to the tone of the game and making
each decision feel risky.

Speaking of, this is a visual novel---but it's also a game with a score. Keeping
the casino theme rolling, you win chips for good choices, and lose chips for
mistakes. You can choose how much you want to bet during all of your riskiest
moves. Ultimately, this doesn't _actually_ change anything. You can spend chips
in a store for phone charms and little things like that, but they are ultimately
just a high score counter. Also, you could just replay a chapter after knowing
all of the twists and max your bets every time to get some kind of theoretical
true maximum score. But none of that matters. What matters is that those little
numbers in the corner add _way_ more weight to every choice than it seems like
they would. They're an unreasonably effective tension accelerant.

Also this game manages to be legitimately one of the funniest games of the year
without betraying its mystery and drama. It's full of references, repeating
bits, and a great balance between intentionally forced jokes and ones that feel
like they naturally flow from the strongly written characters' personalities.
Reminds me of the Like a Dragon series in a very good way, and I think that is
yet another inspiration they pulled from.

Now, all of that would be good, great, or fantastic depending on your tastes---
but in such a strong year, it still might be hard to break into a top 10 list
like this. Yet here it is! So what gives? We'll have to dig into spoilers for
that, but I highly, _highly_ recommend you go into this blind if any of the
above sounds interesting to you. **Especially** if you're like me and the mere
suggestion of going into a game blind makes you more excited for it because that
means it has delicious secrets to uncover. Just go play it. Episode 0 is a free
demo that's like an hour long, and contains this spoiler revealed in a much more
interesting way than you'll get here.

But if you're still reading: ||The game's marketing material suggests that if
you are falsely accused, you need a **killer lawyer**. They don't just use that
word as part of the aesthetic and tone. It's literal. You play as a psychopath
who is one of the vanishingly few successful (feels weird to use that word)
murderers left. It's a _wicked_ twist that I didn't see coming, and it makes
every case more interesting. You see, if this world is so good at catching
criminals, and you're running around leaving crime scenes that _don't_ point to
you, inevitably someone else takes the blame. That someone else now needs a
Defense Attorney with a reputation for acquittal. See where this is leading?
Every case is a balance between trying to reveal information that proves your
client innocent, without accidentally showing your very guilty hand.||

I love the art. I love the music. I love the writing. My only complaint is that
I NEED MORE.

Once again, you'll be able to get the vibe of this game way more from a trailer
than from my words. So here's my favorite (33 seconds):

https://youtu.be/Ux4BwLGgji4?t=1

I'm extremely excited for more episodes to be released. I have a feeling this
game will only rise in my ranking as more content releases. So far, each episode
has had a nicely self-contained story, but also some threads that weave together
for an overarching narrative. I certainly want to see what kind of finale that
leads to, but I'm honestly just excited for more content in general. I'm
confident that it's going to be a very good time.

## Clair Obscur: Expedition 33

**Rating: 9/10**  
_Playtime: 40 hours_

What can be said about Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 that hasn't been said
already? This is by far the most discussed game this year. Maybe it's just the
recency, but it _feels_ like the most discussed game of the generation. It broke
records for the number of Game Awards it took home. You can't wade 2 feet into
gaming discourse without this one being being brought up.

All that, and it sits here at #6 on my list.

Tangential to the game---I find the discussion around it exhausting. I'm glad
people love the game, but it's taken to such a ridiculous extreme it borders on
cult-like fanaticism. Some people are unwilling to accept that others may not
particularly enjoy even a single element of this game, let alone that the game
might have an actual flaw or two. If you even _dare_ suggest that this game is
"an incredibly good game" and not "a flawless masterpiece," suddenly you're
drowned in "I don't understand all the hate" and similar flippant comments.
Meanwhile, people misquote and over-glorify the development story of the game,
ignoring all the work done by those not in the very specific marketing spotlight
and pretending the game is more of a miracle than it is. It's already a
fantastic game and a fantastic development story, pumping it up further only
cheapens it! Good faith discussion on this game is impossible to find.

I'm sure there are people who are attacking the game from the other side,
unfairly dunking on the popular thing just because it's popular. I'm sure those
unfairly negative comments have riled up some fans and now they've gotten
defensive. But from my perspective, the defense has responded back with an order
of magnitude more force. While writing my first draft of this, I felt the need
to soften the words "incredibly good" with a praise sandwich.

As alluded to, I think this game falls into the "incredibly good" category, and
not the "flawless masterpiece" category. I think it has some objective flaws,
and some elements that hurt the experience for me subjectively. Still, it's
easily one of the best games of the year, and one of my all-time favorite JRPGs.
The good parts _are really good_.

I don't feel the need to sell anyone on this game. That's been done plenty
already. **Obviously** the performances are amazing, the art direction is
incredible, and the world is unique and interesting. The gameplay is a really
cool fusion of action and turn based RPGs. That's all stuff you already know.
What I'll talk about here is _why it's only #6_, which is all pretty negative.
But I promise I'm very positive on the game as a whole.

First off, I was not a fan of the way progression worked out. Early game felt
amazing. Mid game started to get a bit funky as balance between abilities fell
apart due to the damage cap. Weak, many-hit abilities were my go-to instead of
single, big hits. It felt needlessly restrictive of my build choices. Then, in
end game, it just kinda shook itself apart. I didn't look up builds. I didn't
farm or do loads of endgame content. I did only the story relevant things at the
end of the game, and built my characters in an "obvious" way. I didn't do any
min-maxing of any kind. I even distributed my Lumina points across the whole
team instead of focusing on a smaller group of characters. I still killed the
final boss in a single hit without meaning to, sacrificing all the drama and
tension and even a few lines of in-fight dialog. I hate this.

Some people really like that though. They feel that the game is rewarding them
for engaging with it in the right ways, as though they've solved the progression
puzzle or something like that. It's a valid way to enjoy games. It's not at all
the way I enjoy games. I want a good, consistent challenge. The best thing a
game can do for me is keep the difficulty curve curated, and there's almost
nothing that boosts my opinion of a game more than having a banger final boss
that takes me more than a few tries to beat. Conversely, the difficulty curve
faltering is one of the fastest ways to ensure my engagement drops off a cliff.

Similarly, I didn't really like the Lumina system. I find point-buy stuff like
that to be too freeform and boring. I want some constraints and restrictions to
spark my creativity. I'm sure this is a very unpopular opinion, but I would have
preferred each character have a more expansive skill tree, and the Lumina system
be left out. The fewer each character's build possibilities overlap with each
other, the more interesting the whole system is.

My other big problem with the game is that I don't think the writing of Act 3
lived up to its potential. In that act of the story, there are some implications
for several of your party members that don't feel explored at all. This
shattered the illusion a bit for me, making them feel fake, and cheapened
several other emotional moments for me. The focus on several party members also
drops off a cliff in the back half of the game. The game tries to make them
relevant in a few ways, including very forced-feeling dating-sim stuff that I
think the game could have done without. It feels like their stories are "done"
and they are just being pulled along by the authors constantly trying to justify
their inclusion for gameplay purposes.

On that note, I think this game would have been way better if it had allowed us
to _feel_ changes to the party happen in the gameplay. ||There are several times
that party members die, but they are either brought back within minutes or are
immediately replaced with characters that fill the exact same party role and
build space.|| All this means there are times that it feels like gameplay
mechanics and not wanting to make the player adapt their builds drove the story,
instead of the other way around. Again, some people prefer that, but I couldn't
be more opposite.

All that said, I still found _a mountain_ of enjoyment in this game, especially
in the early hours. It absolutely deserves Game of the Year from shows like The
Game Awards. It absolutely deserves the hype it has received. In any other year,
this would be extremely hard to beat for me. My placement of Expedition 33 at #6
on my list is more a sign of my love for the games ahead of it than any sign of
dislike for this game.

## The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy

**Rating: 9/10**  
_Playtime: 50 hours_

For my next trick, I will be attempting to justify placing this weeb trash
(affectionate) above everybody's darling, Clair Obscure: Expedition 33.

It's the battle of excessively long titles with a colon in the middle, and this
game is winning. No other game this year can even approach this title's
impressive girth.

The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy is several things. It's a visual novel.
It's a tactical RPG. It's a Persona-ass game with social links and a calendar
system, set in a school. It's a sci-fi war story. It's a miracle that this game
ever released.

The "Hundred" part of the name comes from two places: The story spans one
hundred days, and there are one hundred unique endings. You might hear that
number and assume that most of those endings are nonsense filler---random
dead-ends only two steps off the main narrative. Games like NieR: Automata boast
twenty six endings, but only _really_ have five, with the others being silly
stuff like "you ate a fish and died". After all, it would be an insane
undertaking to write one hundred actually unique endings. Well, this game is
only _mostly_ insane. Those hundred endings are grouped into different plot
arcs, branches of a massive tree. _Some_ of those endings are small dead-ends
within their respective branches, but **most** are actually unique storylines.

The quality of those storylines varies. I have heard this game described as pure
wish fulfillment for fans of the genre. As one of those fans... yeah. It kicks
ass. It's got everything. One of the branches turns the game into a dating sim
visual novel, where all the sub-routes are based on each romance option. Date
the main antagonist if you want, why not? There's a harder sci-fi branch that is
very difficult to unlock that gives games like 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim a run for
its money. There's a shōnen branch that can optionally split into an endless
summer vacation or tournament arc. There are multiple horror and mystery arcs,
including even slasher and death-game options. This game is an all-you-can-eat
buffet of whatever tropes you enjoy. Don't like shōnen? You can just not do that
one. Want to keep things more serious? You can avoid every comedy and fluff
route.

The main story is pretty great, in my opinion. It is **packed** with twists that
really got me. You spend so long with the cast of characters that you get to
know them extremely well. It's a very character-focused story, so that's vital.
The emotional stakes hit me directly in the heart. Importantly for my taste in
games, the mechanics help tell the story in extremely creative and impactful
ways. I think that this is not the best story told this year, but it's the best
_game_ story told this year, and that's important to me.

That said, I do have a few negative things to say about the narrative. First,
this is a game made by the creators of the Danganronpa and Zero Escape series. I
love both of those dearly, but they are very much _not_ to everyone's tastes. As
mentioned earlier, though, I'm a Danganronpa sicko through and through. Still, I
felt the game pushed the cringe envelope a little too hard, a little too often.
There were perhaps a few _dozen_ too many sex jokes and "the author's barely
disguised fetish" moments. It felt like there was a quota for them, with how
forced some were. Second, there are some pacing issues. Sometimes there would be
like seventeen days in between plot events. So you'd go through the daily
motions seventeen times: get up, have a scene or two with the rest of the cast,
do the social link bonding time thing, go to bed, repeat. Those conversations
did do a lot to develop the cast over time, as they were always interesting and
always moved the character-driven parts of the story forward. There were just so
many that it's hard not to call it a flaw.

The gameplay also had similar repetition issues, but thankfully those have been
patched out. You can now skip battles you've already seen. You can now skip
pretty much any minigame you want, though you'll be rewarded less for it. They
even shortened some of the animations and added skip buttons for repetitive
cutscenes(for example, ones that would play at the start and end of every single
day).

Even without those improvements, I think this game had some of the strongest
gameplay of the year---but with them, I have nothing but praise for it. That's
right, a visual novel with fire gameplay; it can happen! This is one of my
favorite tactical RPGs of all time. It rejects a lot of genre norms and paves
its own path. It rejects attrition and rewards aggression. Though I have yet to
finish Bloodborne, I was reminded most of how that game flipped some key genre
expectations. The mechanics are extremely fun and interesting, and really help
sell the story.

The harmony between narrative and mechanical expression is so strong, that I
don't think I can successfully talk about it here, even with spoilers. If I
wanted to, I think I'd have to write a full-length review of the game, not a
single section in a post on a broader topic. I ask you to trust me. This is the
kind of stuff I care most about in games as a medium, and this game does it
better than almost any other I've seen.

I could go on and on with praise for this game, but I won't. I will instead end
this section by saying that the roughly 50 hours I've spent with it have only
really scratched its surface. There are _tons_ of routes I haven't explored---
stories it is prepared to tell but I haven't taken the time to listen. I will be
returning to this game for years.

## Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector

**Rating: 10/10**  
_Playtime: 10 hours_

If you are connected with me on any of the remaining social media sites I still
use, you probably saw me change my profile picture to the main character of this
game. You may or may not have known that it was from the game. If not, now you
do! I did so because this game and its predecessor spoke to me on a very
personal level.

Gareth Damian Martin, the game's creator, is a relentlessly talented author,
artist, and game designer. They are non-binary, and you can feel how much of
that lived experience is poured into their work. It's what resonated with me
most, as someone who has been on a journey of gender self-discovery over the
last several years. But there's more.

Citizen Sleeper and it's sequel are about relentlessly capitalistic hellscapes.
You play as a Sleeper, a consciousness cloned without memories and sold to a
megacorporation to be part of a plausibly non-human workforce. Your robot body
has planned obsolescence for DNA and a heavy reliance on their very expensive,
patented stabilizer injections. You experience the sensations of reality
differently than those around you. It's hard not to see the metaphors here. I'm
once again lifting an extremely queer, neurodivergent game to the top of my
list.

These games isolate you with oppressive mechanics. You can wake up, and it's
just a bad depression day today and you'll get nothing done. But rent is due,
you haven't been medicated in days, and you're struggling to hold it together.
Also going out in the world to trying to solve any of these problems means
risking running into assholes who are willing to cause you harm for who you are.
There are clocks everywhere, on all your problems, all ticking towards
detonation.

But then you risk it. You reach out to someone. You form a connection. They help
you. You help them. You discover good people. You form a community. You find a
family.

The sequel explores the horror and beauty of physical existence. It constantly
reminds you that your body is always changing, always getting damaged, and
always being repaired. Our physical forms are the record of our lives, both good
and bad. Our bodies are a canvas for the art of our lives. That canvas is given
meaning by its fragility and ephemeral nature. The only time you can experience
it is right now. We can never go back, but we can look back, and we can look
ahead. And that's beautiful.

I think this game might have one of the top 5 best endings a videogame has ever
had. It's so spectacularly emotional, and answers all of the game's themes
perfectly. It's told through Gareth's delicate and intimate prose, backed by a
soundtrack purpose-built to snap your heart in half.

This is a profoundly hopeful game. I want to give Gareth a hug.

## UNBEATABLE

**Rating: 10/10**  
_Playtime: 20 hours (and counting)_

In 2020, I saw a trailer. It was for a scrappy indie title, clearly full of
passion. It featured a punk girl with pink hair beating the shit out of musical
ghosts. The art was hand drawn and had a style that drew me in immediately. The
music rocked. Everything about it was a little bit messy, but it sparked a
strong emotion in me.

In 2021, I became a backer. I played the "White Label" demo countless times. For
a period of several months, I'd open it up almost daily. I was practicing. I
_wanted to be good at this one, so badly_. I loved the music. I loved the art.
It was several steps better than that initial trailer, already. I climbed the
difficulty options, one by one. It wasn't long until I was playing every song on
the hardest difficulty. Then they release a new, higher difficulty. I started
playing on that. Every new song that released, I would try to full combo. I ran
out. I started trying to full perfect combo.

Every few months, I'd be back for more. A burst here or there, playing every day
until my hands hurt for a week or so. Then came the long wait.

In 2025, **UNBEATABLE is here.**

The game is messy. It's uneven. It's imperfect. But I don't really care. It's a
10/10. All of that messiness just makes it feel more human. If any game has a
soul, it's this one. It reminds me of 1000xResist, in that way. In fact, it sits
right next to it on my list of top 10 all-time favorites.

Every part of this game is messy in that same, enrapturing way. The music sounds
like demo tapes, garage recordings, and live performances. The art is a fusion
of hand-drawn 2d sprites and 3d environments that make the characters look like
graffiti sprayed over a lived-in world. The voices are not professional actors
but just people like you and me. The writing is full of inner monologues that
are so incredibly personal and relatable. It's all delivered with the emotion of
a human soul laid bare in front of you in a way that words alone cannot express.

_Thinking_ about this game gives me goosebumps. It spoke to me in a very deep
and personal way. This is what art is for. I think it hits me so hard because my
brain aligns very strongly with the particular brand of queer and neurodivergent
that this game evokes so strongly that "wearing it on its sleeve" sounds too
weak. Plus, in a society that is growing ever more authoritarian, "the most punk
game you've ever played" is exactly what the doctor ordered.

So I've gone on and on about how much this emotionally impacted me, but what
actually is it? It's a rhythm game, but like none you've played before. I think
the gameplay trailer says it best, so just watch that:

https://youtu.be/XwKFOZeJukA

If that looks at all interesting, let me tell you it's actually better than the
trailer suggests. I gave this game an award for Best Set Piece. It would be hard
for a game that's just an arcade mode and a story mode to land that. No, see
this game builds itself up over time in immensely creative ways. It layers and
weaves mechanics together just as it does its many plot threads. There are
rhythm heaven style minigames. There are traditional rhythm game songs. There's
a whole rhythm-based combat system. In the best cases, all of those happen at
once. When all the pieces come together at the climax of each chapter, it's
truly some insane stuff that either plastered a huge dumb smile across my face,
made my jaw drop, or started the tears flowing. Often a combination.

Part of me wants to drop videos of my favorite set pieces, but I _really_ don't
want to spoil the absolute delight of encountering them for the first time
yourself and witnessing the cleverness firsthand. But I will talk about one that
is more of a "design I felt with my soul" than an impressive spectacle.

||When I first started playing the demo of this game, a track called Perfect
Rhythm was my go-to practice track whenever I wanted to increase the difficulty
I was playing on. It was my training music. Very late in the game, there's a
segment in which two previous boss fights catch up with you at once. They've got
you surrounded. With a "so crazy it might just work" plan, one of your allies
starts live-mixing both of their boss themes together with Perfect Rhythm. It's
an ABSOLUTELY INSANE mashup that works way better than I expected, as though all
these tracks were made to work together from the start. Now I'm fighting both
bosses at once, as well as the monsters summoned by Perfect Rhythm, all while
timed to my very own training music. It felt like I was one with my character
like that episode of Evangelion in which Shinji and Asuka use music to
synchronize. It was also a _stupidly_ hard fight, but I somehow pulled through,
and I think it truly was due to my familiarity with the music. It's just...
genius, man.||

On top of that, the arcade mode is also perfect. It's a constant delight. I
discovered the other day that there are a few songs that only appear when you
have the highest difficulty selected. I'm still unlocking new songs as I play
and unlock achievements. It's a never-ending box of surprises. The interface is
gorgeous and snappy. The library of songs is massive. The individual song maps
are creative as hell. The modifiers are fun to mess with and are great for
practicing tricky parts of songs in new ways. It's everything I could have asked
for from a rhythm game.

You can play the entire 12 minute finale medley in the arcade mode, and
it's just as emotional there as it was at the end of the game. Why not?

What I really love about the gameplay is that it's essentially rhythm game power
fantasy. It _seems_ really difficult, but it's actually so smooth and delightful
to play. The skill in playing the game is all in reading the notes, not in
having to pick one of four or five different buttons. There are only two, and
you get multiple copies of each in case you need more fingers to spam. Also,
since the challenge is so much more about reading than executing, you can really
feel yourself get better at each song. Nailing a track feels better in this game
than any other rhythm game I've played, and I also managed to get up to speed on
it faster than any other.

**UNBEATABLE** lives permanently in a corner of my soul now.

## Hollow Knight: Silksong

**Rating: 10/10**  
_Playtime: 60 hours_

I don't enjoy Search Action games. At least, I keep stubbornly telling myself
that. "Backtracking sucks!" I say. "I hate feeling like I've missed something!"

These excuses didn't stop me from playing at least one per year, for the past
several years. This year, I played two! I've started long-term plans to someday
return to the genre's roots and explore the best it has to offer. I really must
hate it.

What is it, about this genre I supposedly dislike, that keeps bringing me back?
Is it that the genre attracts some of the most talented game designers, creating
works of art so demonstrably good that I am forced to begrudgingly accept them?
Or, is it that I'm simply wrong? It can be both things.

This resistance of mine is, I think, a defense mechanism. If I dig deep, what
I'm really saying is that I'm tired. I don't want to search anymore. I want to
get to the end. I want to get to the good stuff: the final fight, the emotional
climax, and satisfaction of a task completed. I want to reach the peak, but I
don't want to climb. It's easier to blame the mountain for being in my way.
After all, I don't enjoy mountains.

So, I rush. I don't want to comb through intricate environments to find trinkets
that will aid me on my quest. How unfair of the game to hide its advantages from
me and leave me to tackle its greater challenges with weaker footing. How unfair
to ask me to engage with it on its own terms. Terms like "the delight of
discovery" and "stopping to smell the roses." Ridiculous. This is why I always
say I don't enjoy mountains.

It's also a self-fulfilling prophecy. I have decided that I don't like this. So
I want to get it over with. So I rush. So I have a worse time. So I reinforce my
stance. I don't enjoy Search Action games. That's why I play them.

This paradoxical, cyclical system of mine has a new problem:

**Silksong is a flawless videogame.** This game is so good that I am _forced_ to
introspect. Not once did I want Silksong to be over. Not once did I regret going
back to previous areas. Not once did I feel I was being treated unfairly.
Silksong challenged me to a duel, looked me in the eyes, and said ["git
gud."](https://youtu.be/ZEI4-c9x1C4) It is relentlessly
challenging in a way that dares you to beat it. I don't know if it's
sportsmanship, mentorship, or rivalry, but it encourages you to be a better
match for it.

<div style="margin: auto; width: fit-content; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">
  <DoubleImage
    under={{
      src: import('@img/shaw.png'),
      alt: 'Change your mindset meme featuring Hornet from Silksong',
    }}
    over={{
      src: import('@img/awooo.png'),
      alt: 'Change your mindset meme featuring a flea from Silksong',
    }}
  />
</div>

I hit 100% completion on this game. I did every possible thing I could before
rolling credits. Maybe someday I'll go back for a Steel Soul run. Who am I? I've
never loved a Search Action game enough to 100% complete it, to say nothing of
further challenge runs. Has Silksong changed me? Or was it a mirror to better
see myself?

What more can I say? The music is incredible. This is one of the
tightest-controlling games I've ever played, and I think that contributed
heavily to why I was able to constantly traverse the world without getting tired
of it. The confidence with which this game hides its secrets leads to a joy of
discovery only rivaled by games like Elden Ring. The Fleas are by far the Best
Little Guys of the year. The action is insanely good, to the point that I'd dare
to say it may be the best of all time. The Cogwork Dancers boss fight is easily
the best of the year, and is one I'll be thinking about for a long time. It is a
marvel of modern game design and a true work of passion. The scope of the game
is so large that it boggles the mind.

There are countless excellent reviews that really get into the details of what
makes this game perfect. I chose, instead, to speak from the heart, because
that's how this game spoke to me.

This Search Action hater has one in their top 10 games of all time.  
I am a hater no longer.

## Kingdom Come: Deliverance II

**Rating: 10/10**  
_Playtime: 60 hours_

This is one of the best games ever made.

It's currently sitting at #3 on my all time favorites list. It's in the company
of Disco Elysium, Outer Wilds, and Fallout: New Vegas. If you know me at all,
you know how much I won't shut up about those games.

This has one of those teams behind it with a level of passion for the art they
are creating that is rarely this evident. Warhorse Studios remind me of Larian.
They know what they have is special, and they have fun with it. If you want to
see the kind of place this is, check out this
[skit](https://youtu.be/AwReYGwQOyc) they released along with the game, full of
references to community memes.

Ahead of the game's release, I watched [a livestream by
CohhCarnage](https://www.youtube.com/live/AQqJCvpmzqE)in which he got exclusive
access to play the opening of the game while on a video call with Prokop Jirsa,
Lead Designer at Warhorse and Sir Tobi, their community manager. He got to
interview them while playing, and they got to bounce comments off of his
reactions. It was an excellent way to preview the game, because the opening
hours are the best I've seen---but also, I could see in the developers' eyes and
hear in their voices that they **knew** they had something special here. They
were so honestly happy to see someone enjoying their work, full of honest
well-deserved pride.

Forgive me for the amount I'm about to write.

### On Genre and Gameplay

The RPG genre is one that means many different things to many different people.
To some, they are games in which you level up and there are numbers that
increase proportionally. To others, it's important that the player is allowed to
impact the world and story in meaningful ways through choices. A strong
narrative could be a core element or a distraction. Side content could be a main
ingredient, or just a garnish.

There are many different sub-genres and labels that developers and players use
to describe these differences. Some of those manage to make things more
confusing instead of less, but that's a topic for another day. Inevitably, when
attempting to cram things into boxes, not everything is going to fit. So the
boxes are stretched to include new shapes.

I would not blame anyone for taking a look at a few screenshots or a few minutes
of Kingdom Come: Deliverance gameplay and coming to the conclusion that it fits
into the same box as games like The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim or Fallout 4. In
fact, back when I actually enjoyed Bethesda's particular style of RPG, that
superficial similarity is how this series caught my eye. I quickly found that it
wasn't like that at all. I bounced off.

Years later, I gave it another shot, and it finally clicked. What I had
perceived as harsh and painful game design flaws, only appeared that way due to
my expectations that this game would fit into a box it was never intended for.
These were not broken and unplayable mechanics, but the game speaking to me in a
language of game design I hadn't yet seen. I have to imagine this was what it
was like to play the first Souls games to hit the market, before their design
language was well appreciated.

I gotta say it -- ~~Kingdom Come: Deliverance is the Dark Souls of RPGs.~~

So, if this game isn't like Skyrim or Fallout 3 or 4, what is it like? I want to
invoke [xkcd 927](https://xkcd.com/927/) here, but that's not _quite_ right.
There's a push to define a new RPG sub-genre for this: the Immersive RPG.
It's... not a great name, but it's not terrible, by RPG sub-genre standards. The
design language of Kingdom Come: Deliverance is as strongly rooted in the
philosophy of the Immersive Sim as it is in Role Playing. So, Immersive Sim,
RPG, [Pen Pineapple Apple Pen,](https://youtu.be/Ct6BUPvE2sM) Immersive RPG.
Immersive Sim and RPG both have issues with their names already, but I see the
idea.

Okay, but what does that _mean_? This is a game of **systems**, all of which
link together and feed into each other. It's a grounded world that tries its
hardest not to remind you that it's a videogame. The game attempts to be as fair
as possible with you, your expectations of it, and its expectations of you. You
won't find invisible walls, but you also won't be able to put a pot over an
NPC's head to steal from them. You don't get to work "around" the system by
abusing the fact that it is a game, and in return, the game never stops you with
something arbitrary.

The biggest hurdle to getting into a game like this is forgetting all those
little RPG idiosyncrasies. For example, many love to treat their RPGs as power
fantasies, and reload saves in order to force favorable outcomes. There's no
shame in that, in my opinion, but it's very much the wrong mindset to bring into
a game like this. Not because it's shameful or anything silly like that, but
because it defeats the purpose. Returning to the Dark Souls analogy, it would be
like removing the Souls mechanic. You could do that, and I'm sure some people
really would enjoy just getting to see all the content that way, but many more
found they loved the intended design after giving it an honest try. Now it's one
of the most common game mechanics you'll see during each new game showcase.

Of course, I don't make these Dark Souls comparisons because I think this game
is truly like Dark Souls at all. In fact, this game's secret is that it's
actually quite easy once you learn to work with it instead of against it. I just
want to point out the change in mindset that is required to engage with it in
the most enjoyable way, even though it _looks_ familiar.

Once you get into it, these systems _are **so** good_. This isn't a case of a
good story draped over a set of good mechanics. The mechanics and the story are,
at all times, perfectly harmonized. There are numerous times the story doesn't
tell you something with words, but _shows_ it to you through the mechanics.
There are just as many times when your mechanical situation will impact the way
the story unfolds. This is, in my opinion, the truest form of the RPG genre. The
protagonist, Henry, is _part of the world_ and you get to step into the role of
playing him.

The mechanical execution of this game is so good that I could write a whole
series talking about the genius game design behind individual parts and how they
link together. Maybe when I'm not neck deep in the writing backlog, I will.

### On Presentation and Acting

This clip is a single minute section of a cutscene. It's technically spoilers,
but without context, I think it only reads as a cool moment, and all it reveals
is the vague direction the story goes in.

https://youtu.be/3_7UZLpWba8

This is straight out of a movie. The cinematic direction of this game is unreal.
The virtual camera work and timing are both stunning. The cinematic flair the
game has evokes a lot of Lord of the Rings vibes. Just look at the opening
credits sequence:

https://youtu.be/gNPh3ULnn6s

Every single shot is just _flawless._

There's one famous, **very spoilery** scene near the end of the game that drops
_Lacrimosa_ on you:

https://youtu.be/4UEs-wWkn2U

That scene is completely optional and missable. There is no mention of it in any
quest log, map, or any other UI. You simply must find it yourself. It's not
hidden, and very naturally discoverable if you are taking things seriously. It
hits _so hard_ stumbling into it without expecting it, and it's one of the best
scenes I've seen performed in a game, **ever.**

I think those three videos give you a good overview of the overall strength of
presentation and range of tone this game has. It can be walking through sunny
fields, being thankful for being alive, and existing in this beautiful world. It
can be comedic---legitimately one of the funniest games of the year when it
wants to be, without hitting the point of annoyance. It can be deadly, lethally
serious, asking dark questions about the meaning of death, experiencing it, and
inflicting it on others.

The characters are all performance captured. Their models are based on their
actors' likenesses. The actors are motion captured while delivering their lines.
Even during intense scenes like swimming for their lives, to give the breathing
and line delivery the most authentic feeling it could get. I know there are
other games this year that had _amazing_ acting in them, but this one takes Best
Acting from me by a good margin.

If I were to judge this game by it's narrative strengths alone, I am confident
it would _still_ land firmly in my top 5 games of all time. I seriously think
this is one of the best stories ever told in a videogame.

This is a true zero to hero story. You start as a poor peasant who has to
scrounge for the money required just to buy supplies for your own job. ||Then
you lose even what you have.|| At the end of this game, you are helping to
topple tyrant kings, risking everything to save the lives of those you love, and
becoming a household name across the realm. All of this happens right in front
of your eyes---the game never handles anything important off-screen. Every
action you take is one that leaves an impact. It's a wonderful adventure that
fills you with emotion. I've seen even people who hate non-fantasy medieval
settings like this end up falling in love with it because of the way the story
is told.

The twists and dramatic shocks this story contains are second to none. The game
is not afraid to let the player read between the lines. It is not scared of you
missing something until it comes up later. It is confident enough to lay out all
the details in front of you, so that you can return to them later to wonder how
you didn't catch them the first time. It asks you to answer tough questions with
limited information. Be true to your heart, especially when it's hard. That is
the game's most essential message.

This section is long enough already, and I shouldn't turn this into a full-blown
review of the game. Someday I hope to write that post for real, perhaps as a
retrospective on both games together. Also, I wouldn't want to spoil a single
moment. I ask that you trust me. This game changed some of the ways I think
about _how game writing can be done._

# Final Thoughts

What a year, huh?

I very foolishly thought I could complete this post in a weekend. I'm sitting
here a month later, still writing. I've agonized over the placement of these
games, which to grant awards, and which must unfortunately be cut. I've put more
effort into this year than any other by a massive margin. I wouldn't have it any
other way.

If you want even more, you can view the complete ranking of all thirty two games
I played in 2025 [on
Backloggd.](https://backloggd.com/u/Drowrin/list/drowrins-ranked-2025/)

I'd like to take a moment to shout out my two latest obsessions in the gaming
space: [Post Games](https://postgame.substack.com/) is a weekly audio-magazine
that covers stuff you're likely not hearing about from other outlets, in a
series of 2-3 segments that all follow a common theme per episode. It's a
wonderful listening experience, and Chris Plante digs up all sorts of topics and
interviews. [Mothership](https://www.mothership.blog/) is a queer and
woman-owned site that discusses how gender intersects with games as a medium and
the trends within the industry. Once again, extremely interesting and
well-written pieces. Support independent journalism!

Thank you very much for reading. Here's to 2026.
