Before I ever sat down with a Final Fantasy game, I had heard plenty of things
about two of them: FFVII, and FFXIII. I'm sure you can guess which one I heard
more positive things about. FFXIII has one of the worst reputations in the
series. I've been excited to get here to see why.

Fortunately, what I found was a pretty damn solid game, full of things I love.
It's flawed, sure, but I think the high points are extremely high, and those
flaws have been greatly exaggerated. It's a shame, because that reputation gets
repeated so often that it causes potential new players to skip it, when I think
it's actually easily in the top half of the best games in the series.

# Development Legacy

I think an interesting place to start talking about this game is to take a look
at its lineage. What other projects did these developers work on, both before
and after this one?

![A simplified chart of the developmental lineage of the Final Fantasy
series](../../img/final-fantasy-lineage.jpg)

I took this chart from [this reddit post](https://redd.it/o9muz1). Obviously,
the complicated history of the series can't actually be summarized this cleanly.
This just focuses on the creative leadership, but each leader did end up
bringing a lot of their team members with them as they moved between projects.
From looking into things myself, I think this gets as close to the story as any
chart like this could, without diving into indecipherable detail-hell. Still,
there's a lot of overlap. For example, Tetsuya Nomura worked as a character
designer for FFXIII while directing the Kingdom Hearts series.

We can see a few interesting things here!

First, this game (and trilogy) share a lot of lineage with the beloved Final
Fantasy X and Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy. Dirge of Cerberus was a miss (I've heard). Other than that, it's all good stuff. As someone who has played a
solid chunk of that branch as well as FFVIIR, I can see the shared DNA
connecting Final Fantasy X all the way to Final Fantasy VII Remake, and Final
Fantasy XIII was a huge part of that!

Second, even though Final Fantasy Type-0 was part of Fabula Nova Crystallis (the
overarching mythology for the FFXIII trilogy), and Final Fantasy XV was
originally going to be part of it---those games were made by a completely
different team, sharing very little with the XIII team. Interestingly, that team
_also_ previously worked on an entry to the Compilation of FFVII: Crisis Core,
matching Dirge of Cerberus for the XIII team.

I bring up the FFXV team because, when FFVIIR came out, I often heard people
talk about how the combat was such a huge improvement to the hybrid action/rpg
mechanics of FFXV. I think that's the wrong comparison. The combat style of
FFVIIR is a very natural evolution of what came before it in the FFXIII trilogy.
I think FFXIII deserves a lot more credit, and I think anyone who dunks on the
combat of FFXIII but praises the combat of FFVIIR hasn't been completely fair
with FFXIII.

The chart is cool, but as I said earlier, it doesn't tell the whole story. Who
actually moved between these projects, carrying their ideas and styles along
with them? Obviously, these games are made by _very_ large teams at this point,
so I can't name all of the developers who worked incredibly hard on these works
of art. For the sake of brevity, I'll focus on the big names at the top---those
with the most influence.

After entering the franchise with FFVII, Motomu Toriyama wore many creative
direction hats for FFX, and then directed FFX-2. He then Directed and co-wrote
the FFXIII trilogy along with Daisuke Watanabe. Currently, he co-directs the
FFVIIR series.

The lead artists for the FFXIII trilogy were Isamu Kamikokuryo and Tetsuya
Nomura. Kamikokuryo had previously worked on FFX. Nomura's art and direction has
been hugely influential across the series from the original FFVII all the way up
to the remake.

The lead composer for the FFXIII trilogy was Masashi Hamauzu, who got started in
the franchise by writing my favorite tracks from FFX. During those projects, he
worked with Mitsuto Suzuki. Now, they are working together to co-compose the
soundtracks for the FFVIIR project.

It should be clear by now that FFVIIR wouldn't be nearly as good as it is
without FFXIII behind it.

## The VII Pressure

The other way FFXIII is connected to FFVIIR is much more unfortunate.

During the development of FFXIII, fan desire for a FFVII remake was reaching
ridiculous levels. BrandoEXP covered in his [excellent FFXIII
Retrospective](https://youtu.be/Y0kw7CorRrc?t=2737) that the first person in
line to buy a copy of FFXII, stood next to the director of that game, turned to
the camera, and instead of talking about FFXII, asked for a FFVII remake. Square
Enix had already been teasing tech demos of FFVII scenes remade on the PS3, and
the Compilation of FFVII project had been ongoing for a long time.

In the middle of the ridiculous pressure from fans begging for a FFVII remake,
Square Enix announced Final Fantasy XIII. It begins on a train. You fight a
robot scorpion boss. It's a dystopian sci-fi/fantasy hybrid setting. The party
is immediately pitted against the local government as rebels. The main character
is an acrobatic soldier with a unique sword.

It was clearly trying to fill the shoes of VII. But it was not VII. It didn't
matter if it was actually good or not. The VII fans will simply not take
anything other than VII. I don't think it's a coincidence that as demand for a
VII remake rose, the more fans collectively hated **everything Square Enix
released**, until finally they got VII Remake.

I want to be clear here that my intention is not to put down FFVII or its fans.
I think Square Enix made a miscalculation by putting FFVIIR off for so long
(though part of why it's so good is precisely _because_ they put it off so
long). I think the even _bigger_ miscalculation was to attempt to release
something **close**. Adding salt to the wound, Square Enix decided ahead of time
that this would be a trilogy for the first time in the franchise. So FFVIIR was
even further delayed. What other Final Fantasy game had plans to release as a
trilogy before the first title came out? Huh. Maybe this team just really likes
trilogies.

How could it not be hated on release? The environment was _primed_ for it to be
hated no matter what it was. Fuel was thrown on the fire by how popular it was
at the time to be a "real internet critic" by hating literally everything. A
general sentiment was also growing in the gaming community that JRPGs were
confusing messes not worth your time. The gaming market had recently gone
through its worst ever year of average review scores, and still hand't really
recovered. People were ready to hate anything. They were _extra_ ready to hate
anything from this series. Unfortunately, the internet clings to old hate for a
very long time, no matter how well placed.

My intention is to lift FFXIII up, because I think it was treated unfairly.
Especially with the hindsight we have now, it's time to let go of old grudges
and give this game a fair chance. It's better than you remember. It's better
than you've heard.

# The Review

This is not a flawless video game, but it's a damn good one. As you read, please
keep both of those things in mind. When I'm defending the game, I'm also aware
that it is flawed. Despite pointing out the flaws, I love the overall package.

The further I got into Final Fantasy XIII, the more I enjoyed it. An
unfortunately common flaw---the early hours are the weakest. However, in a JRPG
context, where games can easily last many dozens of hours, "the early hours"
does a lot of heavy lifting. For me, that lasted about 16 hours. That's a large
time investment to get to the good stuff.

Those early hours weren't all bad though. Sure, they were the _weakest_ part,
but they were at least mildly enjoyable for me. I got to see all sorts of cool
environments, watch character arcs start to unfold, and feel the gameplay layers
begin to stack. It just... takes too long.

Pacing is the largest issue with the early hours of FFXIII. There are a few too
many fights, a few too many duplicated corridors, and way too many zone
gimmicks. I hope that this game gets remade some day with all the fat cut from
this section. Unfortunately, it came out in the _terrible_ era of "games have to
contain at least 60 hours of content to be worth $60," so it was rigged from the
start. Plus, Square Enix is still packing their modern games with loads of
padding and side content, so maybe my hopes for a remake to be **smaller** are
doomed.

Once the pieces finally come together, this game really flies.

## The Port

I played on PC through Steam. Unfortunately, this version is known to have some
issues. Performance issues, crashes, strange bugs, you name it. My favorite was
that the game would freeze exactly every second as it scanned for new
controllers.

Fortunately, there are some pretty good mods to help smooth over the worst
issues, but they come with tradeoffs. For example, disabling the controller scan
to avoid the freeze every second meant that no controllers could be connected
with the game running. I'd have to remember to turn on my controller ahead of
time, and if it shut itself off while I was watching a cutscene, I'd have to
restart the game.

There are also some mods to fix up some quality issues. For example, the
pre-rendered cutscenes are harshly compressed in this version, especially the
audio data. There are mods to replace those files, but they can get pretty
heavy. They go all the way to the hundreds of gigabytes range to include 4k
upscaled videos. You don't have to go all the way to that extreme, but it's
available.

Installing those mods was a little bit of a hassle. The community is split
between several different installation methods, and to get the latest version of
the most-automatic method, you have to join a discord server. Instructions you
find online also might not match the modern installation methods, or might be
intended for an entirely different installation method in the first place.

Once they were installed though, my experience was pretty good. Not rock solid,
but good. I had one major crash that set me back an hour. The game would still
always crash on alt-tab. Some of those upscaled cutscenes I downloaded were
filled with more AI jank than I hoped. Still, if I tried my hardest not to
accidentally spook the game by doing something it didn't expect, my framerate
was steady and I could play without fear of crashes.

It's worth keeping all of this in mind if you are considering playing the game.
As far as I know, the PC version is still the most accessible. There is no port
onto modern consoles, nor does it work through backwards compatibility. These
mods were a pain, but it's still the best option at present. Just be aware of
what you're getting into.

## Gameplay

Alright. Alright. Let's get into everyone's favorite complaint: **Linearity**.

I've got a secret to tell you that Square Enix doesn't want you to know: _every
Final Fantasy game is linear_. In a pattern so commonly repeated that it feels
intentional, Final Fantasy games tend to have a very linear story for most of
the game, opening up for side content near the end. In most other games, it's
the iconic **Airship Moment**. There are a few things that always make that
moment so memorable, and linearity before that point is a key ingredient. It's
hard for something to feel suddenly more open without being somewhat closed
before.

Suddenly, the world opens up, and you can go anywhere. You can access so many
previously unaccessible locations. You can play through side quests, grind up
your characters' stats until you've broken the game, and then challenge the
superdungeons and/or superbosses. Sure, before then, you could explore a little,
but generally you were limited to specific areas. There would be mountains,
rivers, and oceans preventing you from straying off the rails of the story. Even
the few games that were more open-ended still had a linear progression of
objectives. Your freedom to choose a direction simply amounted to a freedom to
_be wrong_. Not super compelling gameplay, in my opinion.

People compare this game with FFX, because that game, too, is linear---but I
find that comparison reveals a lot about what they are actually complaining
about. Some people find FFX to be too linear, and put it in the same bucket as
FFXIII. Some people wish FFXIII was more like FFX. What's going on there?

I think, when people say this game is linear, and they wish it was more like the
older titles, they are actually saying something different. Not all of them even
agree on what that different thing is! It's just that they can all be
misconstrued as linearity. So everything got funneled down into that one easily
repeatable idea.

I posit that there are three categories of complaint all tucked under one
late-2000's gamer-rage umbrella.

1. Actual linearity is the problem. I would guess that most of these people
   weren't actually huge Final Fantasy (or JRPG) fans in the first place, and
   just dogpiled on the latest big-budget entry in a genre they don't like. That
   or the smoke and mirrors of previous games worked well enough on them that
   they never noticed the rails at their feet. This game was just obvious enough
   about it that they finally realized it.

2. No overworld map is the problem. These are the players that also found FFX
   too linear, but somehow found earlier titles more open. I think these players
   just wanted their classic JRPG style back. I don't blame them! An overworld
   map can be a great tool for grounding the world and giving it a better sense
   of scale, and it could have potentially improved both FFX and FFXIII. I just
   think this gets shoved under "linearity" too often.

3. The lack of towns and NPCs on the path is the problem. These are the players
   that _did not_ find FFX to be too linear. I think this is the most valid
   complaint. Sure, the story didn't really allow for it, _but they could have
   made the story allow for it_. Plenty of other Final Fantasy games have you
   acting against the governmental structures around you. Being a rebel is
   practically baked into the DNA of the series! And those games got away with
   it!

I don't break out these categories to defend the game. In fact, I think this
shows the game had _more_ flaws than just linearity. I just think there's value
to the nuance represented by each of these points. Also, depending on your
tastes in games, some of these flaws might sound better or worse than linearity!

For me personally, these things were minor letdowns, but not serious hindrances
to my enjoyment. I can absolutely enjoy a linear game. In fact, I tend to get
frustrated when a game is too open in the wrong ways. I get open-world fatigue
pretty easily if a game doesn't walk a very fine line, balancing that freedom
with meaningful experiences. On the other hand, points 2 and 3 were annoyances,
but no more than that.

You might be the type of gamer who doesn't really care about the world map or
stopping by all the NPCs for conversations. Maybe you just want to get on with
the story and keep the pacing as tight as possible. If that's you, I actually
think the supposed flaws in the structure of the game may be features for you.

I want to talk more about when this game "opens up." It doesn't exactly have an
Airship Moment, but something like it. It does, ironically, happen immediately
after you crash-land your airship. Before this point, areas were pretty linear.
There were small offshoots you could explore for loot and optional encounters,
but otherwise you had a goal in one direction and a specific path to get there.
Even the enemies you fought along the way were pre-planned, with few
opportunities to avoid them. When you reach ||Gran Pulse||, things change.
There's a massive open field full of optional encounters and loot. There are
sidequests for the first time in the game. This is where you could grind for a
while and face superbosses if you wanted to, just like the Airship Moment in
other Final Fantasy games.

There were a few things I liked about this area. You could hear extra banter
between the party members as you walked by landmarks and view optional cutscenes
in certain locations. A lot of good character development happens out there, and
it was fun to stumble on it. I also enjoyed exploring the side areas and seeing
interesting parts of the world. Some of those sidequests were also really cool,
involving unlocking additional areas, Chocobo riding, cool boss fights, and
further character development. The lore for the area is also pretty sweet.

Unfortunately, it wasn't all great. There's a _lot_ of filler here, and if you
wanted to get to the hardest and coolest stuff, you'd need to grind for a very,
very long time. There are 64 sidequests in this region, and almost every single
one is a simple "go to this location, kill these enemies" instruction. That
alone would be boring, especially since most of them aren't even special bosses.
However, it's worse than that. You can only have one quest active at a time, and
you can't see how far away the target is. Additionally, the quests are gated by
progress. So completing 8 of them might unlock 3 others scattered across the
world. There's no way to tell which ones got unlocked, nor a way to tell what's
required to unlock the one you're looking at. So the game asks you to do a lot
of running back and forth across the world, checking all the quests.

I... didn't want to do that. I used a guide to do the first 14, a number
recommended by the community because it unlocks a few neat things and gives you
about the expected progression for the next few zones. Even then, I think that
process took me more than 6 hours. I do think that was worth it, because it's
also how I discovered those cutscenes and stuff I mentioned above, but it was
still a long time to dedicate to this one task. Disclaimer: I'm a sidequest
sicko who enjoys FFXVI, so take that as you will. It may be worth skipping if
that's not you.

Before I dig into specific gameplay categories, I want to praise this game for
dropping the resource attrition of earlier games. I know some people really love
that kind of gameplay, but I couldn't be happier without it. Gone are the days
of entering menus to spam Cure and Potion between every fight. No longer do we
need to worry about coming up for ~~air~~ Ether while delving deeper and deeper
into dungeons. Final Fantasy XIII starts you out at full health at the beginning
over every fight, and there's no mana system in sight. This game places a fight
in front of you, and expects you to beat it _now_---no items, no farming, no
excuses. You have everything you need. Now it's up to your skill.

### Progression

Extremely early on in the game, one character has an extra ATB segment. This
signals that they are different in some way. The rest of the gang catches up
eventually, and the timing makes it immediately clear: ||As soon as they became
l'Cie, they gained an ATB segment. This character stays at the same number they
already had. They were secretly already a l'Cie!|| It's a clever way to use pure
gameplay mechanics to help tell the story.

I've talked about it before, in my other Final Fantasy reviews: I strongly
prefer when my party members are each unique in some way. It's even better when
the progression I achieve on each character is tied to that character, so that I
can't swap it all around. I want to feel invested in my party members through
gameplay, and systems that allow transfers or make each character fully
customizable cause me to lose that feeling of investment pretty fast. I want to
feel like "I knew Barret could take that hit, because he's a badass!" not "I
knew Barret could take that hit, because I equipped my tank build!"

Final Fantasy XIII does _pretty well_ at this. There are six party members, six
roles (essentially classes/jobs), and each party member gets access to three of
those roles. It sounds like there would be a lot of overlap. There are only so
many possible combinations. However, there are very important differences. Each
party member has a different affinity for each role. For example, you could make
Lightning a Medic, but that's more of a backup role for her. She'll be stronger
on offense, and you can tell because those other roles have things like new
equipment slots on them and more ATB segment upgrades.

Additionally, and even more crucially, the ability tree for each role is unique
for each character. Both Hope and Sazh are good at buffing your team, but Hope
leans harder into defense buffs while Sazh grants offense buffs. I used Sazh
wherever I could for most of the game, because he could give me Haste. However,
I still pulled out Hope for fights in which I was having trouble surviving. Fang
doesn't lean as heavily into counterattacks as Snow does, but she can heal
herself while tanking. These differences really do make each character feel
nuanced and unique despite fulfilling the same role. And that's just it---these
aren't jobs, they're _roles_. A role can be filled in many ways.

Those role differences, the unique role combinations per character, and the role
affinities made each character feel unique and interesting. Combining those
extremely complex characters into parties was fun! The gameplay differences were
also well aligned with each character's personality in clever ways. More synergy
between gameplay and story!

I know this isn't something everyone appreciates, but I liked how the
progression trees would expand with story progress. It made the difficulty curve
feel constantly curated and intentional. You could never accidentally over or
under level, because you could only progress a certain distance down each tree.
It also encouraged me to make each character more versatile, instead of
specializing them. All my characters being well-rounded was a real blessing
later on in the game, and I'm sure if I was given the option to specialize early
on, I would have fallen into that trap.

Finally, I appreciated the quality of life of full XP share. Plenty of games
have something like it, but FFXIII really took it to a new level. Not only do
inactive party members earn equal XP, so do party members who are completely
missing for story reasons! This was _huge_ in those "early hours" when the party
spent most of the time split up. Every time the story shifted focus between the
small groups, you'd be greeted with a mountain of XP ready to spend. Felt like
Christmas, lighting up those skill trees. Even better, you'd _often_ have just
unlocked a tree expansion due to story progress, so you'd get to see all the new
sections of the tree with a bank of points ready to spend on them.

Unfortunately, everything about it was just too slow. You spend a lot of time
with very basic abilities that don't do anything interesting. You spend most of
that time playing with only two party members at a time. Sometimes only one!
Even the upgrade menu itself, called the Crystarium, is slow. It's got long
animations for opening it up and switching between characters. Unlocking each
individual node has to be done by holding down a button and watching points
slowly get allocated to it. It's glacially indulgent in every way it can be.

Another negative for the progression system is homogenization at the end. I
praised the game earlier for granting each character a different take on their
respective roles, but that's only accurate for most of the game. By the endgame,
all characters will have unlocked _most_ abilities for each role. Those
differences I talked about were actually mostly unlock _order_. Once the order
no longer matters, it becomes a pure numbers game: "Who has the best stats for
this role?" Unfortunately for my boy Sazh, Hope eventually learned Haste, and
had so much more magic power that there was no reason to include Sazh in a party
from that point onwards.

Those last levels of the Crystarium were also brutally slow to make progress in.
I could go through half a dozen fights, and maybe one character would have
enough points to go from 4200 health to 4300. That's not even enough to take
another hit from any enemies this late in the game! Upgrades got pretty boring,
and it would take so much absurd grinding to get everything done that I started
barely paying attention to it.

Speaking of the Crystarium, I don't really like this "earn points and spend
them" style of progression. After every battle, I could see how many Crystarium
Points I had earned, but I had no way to contextualize that number. Was that
halfway to a new ability? A tenth? Can I buy an ability right now? I miss the
excitement of leveling up and seeing what changes about the character. Instead,
this system asks you to repeatedly check through several layers of menus to see
if you can get a tiny increase or not---and I do mean tiny. There's a saying in
the speedrunning community for this game, "stats don't matter." They are
constantly hunting for new ways to cut Crystarium Points from the run, because
they can beat every story fight without hardly allocating points at all. The
combat effectiveness gains are so tiny in this game that accessing the menu to
level up is a time loss.

I don't think this game needed equipment progression at all. I think it
needlessly complicates the game. Some games make good use of it, but not this
one. Worse, this is _a really bad equipment system_. Every piece of equipment
can be upgraded, but that's a relatively permanent process that consumes tons of
resources, in a linear game with limited resources. Why would I upgrade my
starting sword if I'm going to get a cooler one later? Why would I use a cool
sword I just found if I already poured resources into this one?

Some people also complain about the upgrade process itself, but I like the basic
concept. There are just two rules to keep in mind: organic materials grant a
multiplier to future upgrade progress, and inorganic materials grant a lot of
progress while decreasing that multiplier. So all you have to do to be efficient
is use organic materials until the multiplier is maxed out, and then dump a
bunch of inorganic materials into it all at once. This organic/inorganic split
actually fits really well with the lore of the world, in which the robot-like
Fal'Cie are sources of immense power, but can never change or grow, and humans
have infinite potential for growth, but start with very little. It would still
be a better game if that whole system was deleted, but I thought that was a nice
touch.

Another level of needless complication just had to exist, though. Every so
often, weapons will reach a level cap, and you need a special item to upgrade
them to a new form. Doing so even changes the weapon's model! That's kinda nice.
What's not nice is that doing so also sets the weapon back about half of its
levels. It has a new, higher cap, but your efforts in upgrading a weapon are
rewarded with an initial downgrade. I didn't realize this for my first weapon
upgrade, which at the time was the _only_ weapon I had been upgrading (on my
main damage dealer), by spending _all_ of my resources. So I was left with a
much weaker weapon and much slower fights for the next few hours until I could
afford to upgrade it back to the level I had it at.

The equipment system also necessitates shops, for both buying pieces of
equipment themselves as well as upgrade materials for them. Shops really don't
fit into the story. That's what that whole linear/no-towns complaint was about!
So, how do they manage to include shops? Magic internet terminals that somehow
deliver you physical objects. I think this is lame, but there's a silver lining.
Many people complain that this is a plot hole, because why would any online shop
serve weapons to random people at any time, especially to known fugitives for
whom the government has locked everything down in order to find? There is an
answer for this, and it's actually another neat bit of foreshadowing hidden in
gameplay elements: ||The Fal'Cie of Cocoon are merely using the party as pawns
in their plot to destroy Cocoon. They _want_ them to be as strong as possible.
In fact, in several of the shops you can access are messages aimed at your party
members directly. Some of them are even kinda creepy! "Your visit to this site
will not be detected by the military, l’Cie. Your access trail has been
concealed by the fal’Cie from the very start." or "Let Cocoon’s own sciences
empower you as you help to fulfill her destiny!"||

The last thing I'll complain about with regards to the progression system is
that huge character upgrades like ATB segments and accessory slots were tucked
deep in specific roles for each character. There's even a special ultimate
ability for each character that requires you to grind quite a bit down a single
tree for. I mentioned this earlier as a neat thing because it guides you towards
the "canonical" role for each character, but it also kinda sucks because it
takes away some choice from you. As I said before, the actual node stat bonuses
are so tiny that they hardly matter, but getting those extra ATB segments or
accessory slots are literally game changing. So investing in any other tree
before unlocking those critical nodes them just feels like an incorrect choice.
It removes one more element of player agency over character progression, in a
game that was _already_ pretty limited in that regard.

I'll wrap this section up with some positivity though: I think a lot of problems
people have with this system would go away if the presentation was changed.
Because the Crystarium is a big network of nodes on a tree, it draws comparison
to Final Fantasy X and implies a large amount of flexibility and many possible
builds. That just isn't the case. The only real choices you make are which trees
to put points into as you earn them, because each "tree" is really just a long
line with tiny branches. However, this could also be thought of as each
character having _three jobs_ and you get to choose which one gets a level each
time you level up. I think that would have been actually praised for its
flexibility---and that's really what it is! It's just presented in a way that
implies something it can't live up to.

Overall, this progression system was above average. It overpromised and turned
out "just okay." That's what has drawn it all this hate. There have been far,
far worse progression systems even in some of the most beloved entries in the
series! Being mediocre at worst ain't so bad.

### Combat

Now this is where the game really shines. This is by far the best combat system
in the series so far (and I'm hoping the rest of the trilogy is even better). I
know that's an extremely hot take, but I believe it. I will attempt to defend
myself (and the game) below.

I have already expressed my dislike for the combat in some of the other games in
the series, so I'll skip over those. The rest are either turn based or use some
form of the Active Time Battle system. So, I'll focus on the best in each
category. I consider Final Fantasy X to have the best turn based combat in the
series, and I _don't_ think that's a hot take. Somewhat more controversially, I
think Final Fantasy X-2 has the best ATB implementation in the series. You can
read about why I think that in [my review of the
game](https://drowrin.com/posts/final-fantasy-x-2/#gameplay). Interestingly, if
we look at that developmental lineage chart from earlier, both of these games
are earlier releases from the FFXIII team! I'll draw comparisons to both games
throughout this section.

Let's get the similarities out of the way. All three games have three active
party members, but that's been pretty common for the series since the PS1. They
each let you switch out either jobs or whole characters mid-combat, and that
dynamic element is a huge part of why I enjoy these combat systems so much. All
three have enemies designed with specific strengths and weaknesses to encourage
you to take advantage of that swap feature. All three allow you to replace the
party (or most of it) with summons. Timing is crucial in all three, even if it's
just turn order management in FFX.

I can see the connecting line from FFX to here. That dynamic party swap feature
combined with the enemy design that takes advantage of it was one of the best
things to happen to this franchise. I think it was a bigger and better change
than even the original ATB system was over the old turn-based games. FFX-2 took
that and applied it to job swaps instead of character swaps, and brought back
the ATB system in the fastest and most fun iteration it's ever seen. FFXIII took
that concept and made the party feel more unified by swapping the whole team all
at once (which also focused more on the action by reducing total swap animation
time). It _also_ takes the different-sized ATB bar concept of FFX-2 and improves
it by splitting the ATB bar into multiple segments that can be used for
interesting combos and fine-grained character control on the fly. The stagger
mechanic also feels like an improved version of the combo chain system from
FFX-2. Hell, your characters can even jump around obstacles in predetermined
spots just like FFX-2.

I've looked ahead a bit, to see the connection to FFVIIR, and that's pretty
clear as well. In Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII you get _three_ ATB
bars, each assigned to a different job/role. You get to move around, hit an
attack button and precisely timed block/dodge buttons. It's almost like the
whole party was condensed down into a single character and action-game elements
were added in. The similarity is becoming pretty clear, right? FFVIIR just
continued further down that path, and split the party back out into three
characters. The stagger mechanic of FFVIIR also came from this game!

I think if the only differences between this game's combat and that of FFX-2
were the enhancements I listed above, it would be a pretty direct upgrade. That
means it wins best combat without any more discussion, right? Well, there's more
to the story. I haven't mentioned the _biggest difference_ between FFXIII and,
not just the other games made by this team, but the rest of the franchise: You
only directly control a single character. You don't get to pick what your party
members will do on their turns. They are controlled by pretty simple,
predictable AI algorithms. This is a major downside for a lot of people. I
thought it would be for me, too. I will return to this point, but it will be
easier to talk about in the context of the complete combat picture.

The second biggest difference is that there's an "auto" button on the combat
menu, which picks abilities for you. It's the default cursor position. This has
led a lot of people to claim that the game plays itself---which, if true, would
make it a terribly boring game ~~like FFXII~~. Unfortunately, the game doesn't
really make a great first impression here. For the first few hours of the game,
it _really_ does just play itself. You don't even earn XP in the early game, you
don't have interesting tactics to work with or roles to switch between. You just
hit that auto button until the enemy dies, occasionally stopping to heal with a
potion or two.

However, is that not like the early hours of every other Final Fantasy game? You
tend to start out with very few options, and just hit the attack button
repeatedly until the enemy dies, stopping for heals. Some games have an extra
option for AoE or magic damage instead of physical, but generally you'll be
spamming those the same way. You earn more options later, and everything gets
more interesting as you progress. The same is true of FFXIII! In fact, this is
an upgrade! Instead of always hitting the same option in the early game, you
have the option of breaking that action down into multiple others, doing a
weaker action earlier when timing is important, and so on.

That timing element is really critical. This is a very active game, and the way
you time your actions can turn the tide of every single fight. The mechanic that
applies earliest is pretty simple: all actions can be interrupted. If you can
repeatedly attack an enemy, you can often prevent them from taking action. Every
attack does a different amount of interrupt potency and every action has a
certain amount of interrupt resistance. Every enemy also has different base
levels of interrupt resistance. Very frequently, it will be optimal to send out
your party leader to start their chain of attacks early, even though they get
fewer total attacks that way, in order to keep the chain going or to interrupt a
spell being cast. Later on, you get more and more mechanics that rely on timing.
You can use spells to modify those interrupt resistances. You can launch enemies
up into the air, where they can't perform any actions at all as long as you
manage to juggle them. You can even optimize your damage by ensuring your party
leader acts before or after the others.

The other element that makes this auto button work so well is that this game
carries on the straightforward style of combat abilities that FFX started using.
You don't really need to worry about applying series classic spells like "float"
or "frog" anymore. Everything serves a more direct purpose that is always useful
in very frequent circumstances. Haste makes you faster, while Slow makes them
slower. You can buff all of your stats while debuffing theirs. Elemental spells
are more effective if they match a weakness, and less if they match a
resistance. The Launch attack only works when an enemy is staggered. Every
single ability has a place (crucially, not a niche) in the combat system, and a
perfect circumstance in which it should be used.

They _could_ ask you to remember this and strain your hand trying to queue up a
series of Slow Deshell Deprotect or Fire Firaga Fire Flamestrike every 4
seconds, but that would be a lot. It would also get very repetitive, and if I
can be so real, I don't think it would have improved the combat **at all**.
Instead, that auto button just queues up the same stuff you would have manually
queued up anyways, reducing tedium and letting you focus on the stuff that
matters _way_ more---timing and paradigm shifts.

Paradigm shifts are how you swap the active roles in your party. You save up to
six paradigms---combinations of your current party's roles. These get
automatically assigned names, which is both cute and useful as shorthand. For
example, "Evened Odds" is Synergist, Saboteur, Medic. Timing these shifts is the
number one skill the game asks you to learn. You should switch to a defensive
setup with a Sentinel and at least one Medic while the boss is charging up a big
attack. You should probably maintain some buffs and debuffs at the start of long
fights. You should have a balance of Commandos and Ravagers to press the attack,
favoring one role or the other depending on the circumstances.

There's tons of nuance to every possible paradigm, and timing those swaps is the
real meat of the game. It's more of an art than a science, and it's absolutely a
learnable skill that you'll feel yourself getting better at as you play. There
are tons of plates to keep spinning, and claims of the game playing itself feel
silly when the game rarely gives you more than a second to breathe. Every 10
seconds or so, performing a paradigm shift instantly recharges your ATB bars.
This is great for squeezing in more actions, but it's also fantastic for
emergencies.

Swapping paradigms and seeing your whole party _immediately_ start performing
actions related to your chosen strategy is a great feeling. It's not a request
for a future modification to the plan, it's **RIGHT NOW, DO THE THING**. Big
boss attack coming up? Swap to that defensive paradigm and watch the Sentinel
immediately throw up a protective shield that saves the party while the Medics
keep them alive with constant heals. It also gives you confidence to squeeze in
a few more attacks between switching, because you can rely on the swift
application of your new strategy. This makes the game feel very responsive and
skill-based, and puts you directly in control of the combat, despite taking a
higher-level-overview strategic role.

Optimally, you'll be swapping paradigms every other ATB activation (thanks to
that free refill), and only one of those involves waiting for it to charge. That
means you have about 8 seconds to decide what your entire team will be doing for
the next two full turns, which is up to 36 ATB segments. During that time, you
also will be managing the timing of your party leader's turns to try and
optimize what's happening in the action. This is a very busy game, and I love
every second of it.

In my opinion, even if this combat system didn't have the ability to split the
characters' ATB bars into multiple actions or use only partial ATB bars for
weaker effects, the paradigm shift system alone would make it superior to every
turn-based and ATB combat system in the series. With that extra timing nuance,
it absolutely smashes the competition.

Now that we have more context, let's circle back on the inability to control
your party members. I will once again say, this is a presentation issue more
than anything. I've already described above how much I enjoy the paradigm shift
system, and how the "auto" button is _still full control over the character_
thanks to paradigms. With that in mind, paradigm shifts are also _how you
control your other party members_. This is not an RPG in which every party
member does something completely different, your party members make up a team
and operate as one unit. The form of that unit is, in turn, shaped by the party
members in it and their respective strengths and weaknesses. You **do** control
the party in this game. You just have **more** control over one specific
character.

I actually think that last part is pretty interesting, and not an objective
flaw. It means that selecting your party leader is an important part of shaping
your strategies. I preferred to have a Commando as my party leader, because it
felt like I had a lot of control over the battlefield that way. Commandos get a
special ability that kickstarts the stagger process if they are the first one to
attack an enemy. So I'd always open combats with a swift-but-weak Commando turn
to sneak in an attack before my Ravager teammates started slinging spells. On
the other hand, if I picked a Ravager as my party leader, I may want to _delay_
my first turn to let a Commando teammate go first. That's just one example, and
there are many more.

I do think it would be interesting if they could grant you timing control of the
other party members, but I think this was largely a control-complexity issue.
They could have perhaps put each party member on the controller triggers.
However, the game was already very busy, and I'm not convinced this would have
added more than a small benefit in niche situations. Controlling a single
character directly is more than enough to control the battlefield optimally in
95% of situations, and is plenty engaging already.

I also want to talk about how the combat system's mechanics fit into the lore
and themes of the game. Humans play a critical role in this world due to their
potential for growth. Much like how organic materials build a multiplier for
equipment upgrading as I described above, you are able to build a multiplier on
enemies called stagger. Once this multiplier fills a meter (different for each
enemy), they become staggered, making it easier to interrupt their actions, and
causing them to take more damage. You can continue to increase the damage
multiplier during the stagger window by fitting more Ravager attacks in, but
Commando has higher overall potential to take advantage of the multiplier once
it is built.

The stagger system is very fun. It's so strong that you're encouraged to plan
all of your gameplay around it. You want to trigger it at the right time, and
ideally dump all of your highest damage abilities into the enemy near the end of
the stagger window where the multiplier will be highest.

What I find really interesting is that the role with the highest damage
potential and the best at controlling this stagger multiplier is the Commando.
This is the most "human" role, which the party starts with before becoming
l'Cie. It's just "hit them with your weapon"---the "fighter" class. Their
Fal'Cie-granted power does enhance the Commando role, but it's still something
that any human theoretically had the potential for without Fal'Cie assistance,
and the role that multiplies the Fal'Cie power to the greatest heights.

This means that, while the Fal'Cie grant the party members additional tools and
power, their greatest strength remains their capability to shake up the balance
by rising to the challenge and tilting the odds in their favor. Just like their
place in the lore! It's a nice bit of harmony between the gameplay and story.

One of the things I love the most about this game is that _it wants you to go
fast_, and it wants you to do so by your skill alone. It doesn't value going
slowly and methodically or grinding to arbitrary goals, it values riding the
edge of defeat for fun and seeing how far you can push your execution. It dares
you to take risks. This game has a rating screen after every fight, largely
based on how quickly you were able to complete it compared to the developers
expectations of you. It's pretty forgiving, granting you a 5 star rating if you
at least understand the systems and put them to good use rather than requiring
perfection. But the existence of that rating screen communicates to you that you
can do better, and you can push the game further. There's more to combat than
winning or losing, there's also _how well you pulled it off_.

Again, the game doesn't really let you grind much. Even if you do in the one
place it's possible, your stats don't change the game that much. The difficulty
curve is kept very curated. You are put up against fights that will be
challenging, but the developers know you have the tools to do it as long as you
can pull off the execution. In some ways, this allows the game to stray more
into the territory of action game than RPG, despite having few of the elements
you'd usually expect from the genre.

I mentioned a speedrunning community before, and how they talk about stats not
mattering. Time and time again, the community has found faster routes by
skipping stats. Execution can carry you to the end. Run-to-run times vary
massively because there is no truly perfect execution. Routes can be optimized,
but every tiny difference in timing between button presses can have a huge
impact on the outcome of a fight, and knowing the nuances of the systems in
order to respond to every one of those possibilities is a must. People have even
beaten this game without spending a single Crystarium Point, like a level 1 Dark
Souls run. This is a game so deep and expressive that playing it is a technical
skill that can be mastered. I don't understand how people think this game plays
itself.

The real issue with this combat system is that _none of the cool stuff works_
for the first few chapters of the game, and it comes together agonizingly slowly
by the halfway point. I did appreciate the mechanical changes when they showed
up throughout that first half of the game, so it's not like that first half was
totally unenjoyable. I just wish they brought it together sooner. If someone is
unable to bear those early hours to get to the good stuff, that's a shame, but I
completely understand.

Again, it's not uncommon for a JRPG to be pretty slow at first. It's just that
this game stretched that slow period out more than was necessary. Still, the
combat in the latter half of the game is so good that it easily makes up for the
rest---making it without question my favorite combat in the series so far.

## Audio

I have very few complaints about how this game sounds. I described above how
this port has some audio quality problems, but that was mostly solved with mods.
It also suffers a bit from "action movie audio balancing." I wish I could turn
the sound effects down a bit to hear everything else better, but there are no
such sliders. Nitpicks aside, I like what we got---especially the music.

### Music

I am quickly becoming a huge Masashi Hamauzu fan. Final Fantasy X was the first
series entry for which Nobuo Uematsu had assistance composing the score, and
Hamauzu's music was what stood out to me most in that game. Back in [my
review](https://drowrin.com/posts/final-fantasy-x/#music), I raved about his
music quite a bit. Uematsu's style focuses a lot on strong melodies, and his
music is iconic for a reason. On the other hand, Hamauzu's style is more complex
and ambient, incorporating more dissonance. He has a modern sound that is just
endlessly interesting to me. His music tends to build for a long time, and vary
the energy levels a lot throughout each piece. Every time I listen to one of his
tracks, I hear a new detail I hadn't found before. Uematsu's sound is catchier
and easier to get stuck in your head, but man, I love the experience of
listening to Hamauzu's work. Both are excellent in different ways, and I think
Hamauzu deserves to be right up there with Uematsu.

Much like the game as a whole, however, not everybody likes Hamauzu's style as
much as I do. Dissonance in particular is something that turns a lot of people
off. Melody being less of a focus also makes the music less enjoyable for some.

I highly recommend [this Resonant Arc video](https://youtu.be/-5Z1-oaJmRA)
breaking down the soundtrack of FFXIII, as well as [this video by 8-bit Music
Theory](https://youtu.be/14lZ2g_oCxI) which talks specifically about Hamauzu's
particular style.

This soundtrack makes heavy use of leitmotifs. I wish I could spend forever
breaking them all down, but I'll just point out the most obvious ones.
[Lightning's Theme](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=wH0hVkOr_3g) is used
frequently, which makes sense as she's the poster-girl. It's an emotional piece
that speaks to me of Lightning's uncertainty and anxiety, but also her
determination to face her fears head on and not let anything she's afraid of
come to pass. It can be heard in [Blinded By
Light](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=WyTRg-DJ99M), which is easily one of my
favorite battle themes in the series. It's got so much drive, and the strings
are so incredible every time. The sudden switch in the middle does a good job
representing how the combat can change in an instant thanks to the paradigm
shift system. Interestingly, there are even references to Lightning's Theme in
[Fang's Theme](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=tZM4TW3bPqs), which is much
more wild and open, evoking images of the wilderness of Fang's home. There are
many parallels between these two characters, and it's cool to see that reflected
in their themes.

[Serah's Theme](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=k9yCnVXkYlY) is also used in
several places. She's the character that ties the rest of them together, and
serves an extremely important role in the story, so again, it makes perfect
sense. [The Promise](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=JNkI08t4rqM) is a softer
instrumental version of it. [Fabula Nova
Crystallis](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=UuuglmZ4pVE), bearing the title of
the setting itself, is a grand, cinematic rendition of Serah's theme. Finally,
possibly one of the most emotionally moving pieces in the game
[Miracles](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=79zyp83bsHo), references Serah's
theme as well.

Several other themes weave in and out of other important tracks, but again, I'm
just focusing on the obvious, easy ones.

I'm a huge sucker for emotional, piano-focused pieces. This OST is full of them!
[Promised Eternity](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=ly7oOVJ_rhQ) and [Memories
of Happier Days](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=AwaKonW5mIM) are both packed
with very different emotions that swell so strongly within me that I feel the
urge to cry from the music alone.

Wrapping up the emotional music, [Dust to
Dust](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQRJHh3VNc) is a beautiful, delicate
piece. It plays during a very bleak part of the game. It's a song of loss and
memories.

[Ragnarok](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Lp2WfNmac) is a super unsettling
choir and organ piece that is extremely rich with detail and texture. It's the
kind of fantasy track that plays in "the ancient holy place," but _something is
wrong here_. This is "the ancient holy place" but _god has abandoned us_. It's a
dark, powerful hymn. I love it.

Changing gears to talk about combat music, I already talked about how much I
love Blinded by Light, but I also have to put a spotlight on [Saber's
Edge](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=TXEB8gdkpqM), the generic boss fight
track. It weaves between different energy levels in way that makes those intense
moments feel even crazier. [Fighting
Fate](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=ewvxLBX0r7E) is another boss track that
deserves attention. The voices in the track are _sorta_ diegetic: the boss for
which this plays is covered in a choir of angelic faces. Also, the choir reminds
me of Ragnarok. That's super cool in context.

This OST also has great area/zone tracks. [The Hanging
Edge](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=msjwMjuaS_Q) reminds me of the Thunder
Plains theme from FFX at first. It's got a lot of pressure to it, and makes me
feel urgency and anxiety for danger ahead. [Lake
Bresha](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah7FCB-o070) is _incredibly_ fitting
its placement in the story. It's full of uncertainty, but it has a driving pulse
that urges you onwards. At the same time, it plays with the wonder of the
otherworldly crystalline structures surrounding you that look almost like a
frozen alien landscape. For something completely different, [Sunleth
Waterscape](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=tbktye3f0oo) is extremely vibey
and catchy, fitting for a lush, sunny paradise zone (and another rendition of
Serah's leitmotif).

That last one, as well as [Will to
Fight](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=8PijzIDM-n4) have a hybrid orchestral
and futuristic sound. This is pretty common throughout, but I think these two
are some of the best examples. I've said before that in some places this OST
reminds me of the soundtrack for Stellar Blade (though the inspiration obviously
flows the other way), and these tracks are why.

Speaking of, there are many, many different styles of music in this OST. [Snow's
Theme](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=zxunixS1MSA) would fit right in with a
Yakuza soundtrack. [Sazh's Theme](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=7dpr4uaNoKk)
is some groovy jazz, but since it's a character theme, it gets played in some
very unfitting scenes. [Daddy's Got the
Blues](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=rVZv9gARIic) is a blues piece with the
same issue. That tendency for character themes to be played despite not fitting
the scenes well is my only complaint about this OST. It would have been perfect
if there were some alternate compositions of the themes in more fitting styles,
like Lightning's theme.

Finally, for some fun, I have to mention the two versions of the Chocobo theme.
[Chocobos of Cocoon](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=jwRo6zv9LuE) is robotic
and a bit discordant, like something is wrong, a perfect fit for Cocoon itself.
[Chocobos of Pulse](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj99s74smPI) is wild and
free jazz, perfect for the free spirited land of Gran Pulse. It also ties super
nicely back to Sazh's affinity for Chocobos. It's easily my favorite Chocobo
theme in the series so far.

### Voice Acting

The voice acting for this game is _yet another_ controversial element. The
actors are supremely talented people. If you look up the main cast, you'll
immediately recognize some big names, and all of them have probably been in
something else you've enjoyed. I think the actors did the best they could given
the circumstances. The voices fit the characters extremely well.

Unfortunately, the localization effort had some issues. This particular Square
Enix team was still struggling with that part of their production efforts. There
are famous issues with the english localization of FFX and FFX-2, and this game
is no different. Though just like those games, the localization issues did not
ruin the game for me.

So, what are the issues? Vanille is frequently called out online as "ear
bleeding" and I think that's pretty extreme hyperbole, but she definitely stands
out. [This clip](https://youtu.be/RsSY4svjABA) from an interview of Vanille's
voice actress, Georgia van Cuylenburg, explains several things. She was asked to
emulate the Japanese performance, including "anime noises" (which clearly made
her uncomfortable) while also maintaining her Australian accent. She ends the
interview by requesting viewers to "give Vanille time, I hope she grows on you."
It seems to me that she was pretty over-directed.

The game was also developed in extreme secrecy, and that certainly didn't help.
Square Enix was scared of leaking anything. Development efforts were kept
extremely private, to the point that teams often didn't know what other teams
were working on. This hit the localization team more than any other. As the
script was repeatedly changed to adapt to changes by other teams, the
localization team would have to re-translate, and then re-record lines,
repeatedly. They were often left with very little time to complete their work.
As far as I know, the final version _still_ has some pretty major differences in
the script due to lack of time to re-localize everything again.

Still, the talent of the actors really shined through, and I overall enjoyed it
even with the localization flaws. The emotional delivery is excellent, the
personalities are well conveyed, and they absolutely helped me fall in love with
these characters.

## Visuals

Finally an uncontroversial section!

This is a fantastic looking game. The tech is showing its age a bit, but the art
direction is so solid that it holds up extremely well to this day. The Final
Fantasy XIII trilogy games are, at the time of writing, the only mainline Final
Fantasy games to not have received some kind of remastered release. Even FFXV
received graphical upgrades for its PC release. I'm sure part of that is due to
the reception FFXIII received, but honestly, I think the bigger reason is that
these games don't _really need it_.

The things that aged the worst, but somehow also look the best, are the numerous
pre-rendered cutscenes this game contains. FMVs are far from new to the series,
but they've never looked this good. Square Enix _really_ stepped up their
animation game with this one. Unfortunately, those videos are 720p, 30fps, and
heavily compressed on PC. Some platforms had it worse, though. The Xbox 360
ended up with 576p.

Fortunately, mods can save the day again. I tried some that upscaled the videos
to 4k, but that left so many visual artifacts that I ended up reverting to 1080p
versions with fixed audio quality---the same experience as the original PS3
version. I also installed a few mods that bump up the texture resolution a bit.

Up until this point, every console generation the Final Fantasy series
transitioned through allowed it to make huge leaps that seemed to redefine what
was possible for RPGs. Final Fantasy IV opened whole new worlds of character
expression and storytelling that were not possible on the NES. Then Final
Fantasy VII brought the series to the 3rd dimension on the Playstation, though
it used pre-rendered backgrounds to get there. Final Fantasy X on the PS2
transcended that limitation and allowed the camera to move smoothly through a
fully realized 3D world (mostly, there are a few pre-rendered backgrounds in
there too).

Final Fantasy XIII is the first generational leap that... doesn't feel like
that. It's higher resolution, and much more polished in its presentation than
the PS2 games, but it doesn't really do anything new. To be fair, there wasn't a
lot of headroom left for it at that point. Games are _still_ being made in 3D to
this day, after all, not some crazier evolution. The only improvements at this
point are fidelity and polish, and that's exactly where FFXIII excelled over the
previous generation. However, I can see why people would be disappointed with
this after every prior generational leap in the series was a fundamental
transformation. I think it's easy to see with hindsight that this wasn't the
game's fault, but simply the diminishing returns on generational upgrades that
the entire industry experiences.

### Character Designs

Unfortunately, I found these character designs to be a mixed bag. The _monster_
design is always fantastic---I love the biological and robotic versions of the
same foes, especially the interpretations of series classics like the Behemoth.
Unfortunately, the rest of the characters in the game are split pretty much
50/50 for me.

I love Lightning's design, of course. She's the poster girl for a reason.
Absolutely iconic and interesting design. Transforming gun/sword combo weapons
will _always_ be cool, and I think this is one of the coolest out there. The
half-cape, the asymmetric armor that protects the side she holds forward in
combat, the way she wears exactly what's practical without slowing her down---I
love it all. She's a badass, acrobatic fighter. I think she was, at the time of
release, easily the best protagonist character design in the series. Even now,
with Clive and Remake Cloud in the mix, she's a strong contender.

I also love Sazh's design. He's just such a lovable dork. The Chocobo chick is
such a huge boost to the design and to his personality, and the way it hides in
his afro is adorable. Dual pistols that can combine into a larger gun is sick as
hell. I also appreciate how his design is pretty simple and straightforward. I
find a lot of characters from this game to be overdesigned and busy.

Fang is another extremely good one. She's got the same asymmetric thing going on
that Lightning does (all the characters do to some degree, but these two have it
the strongest). She's also the only other character with the knee-high boots +
bare legs combo that Lightning rocks. She looks ready to fight at a moment's
notice. However, while Lightning is a practical, orderly soldier covered in tech
and gear, Fang is a wild warrior with a huge weapon and flowing, almost
ceremonial-looking robes. Badass berserker lady is a hell of a vibe.

Unfortunately, that's where the praise for the party character designs stops.
Vanille is okay, but her design is a lot busier than Fang's and I think it would
look better with a lot of the extra details removed. Hope's design is similarly
overdesigned. Did this kid really need two different gloves, one with a random
piece of cloth tied around it, a scarf that clashes with everything else he's
wearing, _and_ a double-layered top in different colors? Give this kid a break!
Snow's gargantuan trench coat covers up anything interesting and turns him into
a blob, and the bandana is awful, especially with the scruffy blond hair
sticking out. He's one of the very few _underdesigned_ characters. I like how he
looks in concept art moderately better, but something about his appearance in
game just doesn't work at all.

The overdesigned characters don't stop at the party. It's pretty common for the
game to drop a _wild_ looking NPC on you and make them seem super important,
only for them to be discarded shortly later. My favorite has gotta be Jihl
Nabaat, who shows up looking like a Bayonetta character and bosses everyone around
for all of three scenes before ||being used as the punchline of a poorly told
joke and killed off screen.|| The one exception is the main antagonist,
||Galenth Dysley. Of course the supreme leader / evil pope is going to be an
overdesigned asshole. That's part of the fun!||

## Story

After hearing so much about how bad this story was, I was pleasantly surprised!
It certainly has flaws, but it also does some things that I _wish_ more games
did. I found the overall package very enjoyable. So much so that I'm _craving_
the rest of this series. I've just gotta finish writing this review first!

One thing I had heard about the game ahead of time is that it relies heavily on
the in-game data log. The game is incomprehensible without it! Or so they said.
I really did not find that to be true. During the first couple chapters, I read
new data log entries as they became available, so that I wouldn't fall behind.
What I found was information that the game had already told me. So I started
checking it less. By the 4th chapter, I stopped reading the data log altogether.
Did I lose track of the plot? Not once!

Much like the linearity complaint, I think the data log complaint is actually
several other complaints stacked together in a trench coat rivaling Snow's.

First, this story is okay with not telling you everything right away. Hot take:
that's a good thing. I love when a story gives me tiny shreds of a concept, or
even just the name of a concept, and gives me time to wonder and theorize about
it. Let me figure out the implications by reading between the lines. I _loathe_
when stories immediately define everything and fill themselves with "as you
know..." dialogue. Let me figure things out! Immediately explaining a concept
the first time it appears is the narrative equivalent of a video game companion
telling you the solution to a puzzle 3 seconds after you start it. However, the
players who don't like this narrative style aren't necessarily wrong, it's just
a difference in taste. Fortunately for me, this game told its story in a way
that I found consistently engaging.

Second, _the characters can lie and/or be wrong_. I love this even more. It's so
interesting when multiple characters have different worldviews to contrast
against each other. It can be a powerful source of conflict or character growth,
depending on how it's used. Reveals feel way more impactful when they shatter a
character's worldview. However, if you are used to (or prefer) "as you know..."
style dialogue, in which the first person to speak of a concept gives the
audience a perfect definition of it, this can seem confusing. Such an audience
might simply give up on the story making sense, and assume it is full of errors
(or assume that the data log is the only source of truth). I do not think this
is the case for FFXIII. All the lies and gaps in knowledge are intentionally
placed as narrative tools.

Third, FFXIII uses a few too many made up fantasy words. There are already
plenty of good words that could have filled the same roles easily enough. It's
neat that Fal'Cie, l'Cie, and Cie'th all share some fantasy etymology, but
"god," "champion," and "fallen" would have been easier to remember and more
descriptive. Some people like unique words like this in fiction, but I'm a fan
of using the words we've already got. FFXIII also throws in acronyms and
multiple military organizations that look similar enough to be confused with
each other. While that is realistic, it doesn't serve the narrative at all.

Still, once I got over those terms, I was thoroughly engrossed in learning about
this world and following these characters. While I can see how the above
narrative presentation style isn't for everyone, it's exactly the style that
keeps me most engaged.

Something I appreciated about the story presentation was that the character's
combat abilities were also used in cutscenes and the like. The party is able to
fly to escape thanks to Fang's flying Eidolon, Bahamut. During the ||invasion of
Cocoon||, the party's Eidolons and magic play major roles in how they survive
the ||disaster of crashing the race.|| The characters frequently use weapons
like guns during cutscenes. There's even a big scene in which Vanille and Fang
get to show off how their weapons are used on Gran Pulse to capture local
wildlife. It's always annoying to me when cutscenes operate on completely
different logic, but this game avoids that.

During this era of ever-increasing game scopes, it seems to me that Square Enix
was failing to adapt to larger development team sizes. Maybe this was victim of
the extreme secrecy they developed this game under. There are some awkward
disconnects in some scenes, as if some teams didn't know what others were doing,
or only imprecise instructions were given. The earliest example is when ||Snow
fails to save Nora, folding under zero pressure. It feels like the story really
needed Snow to fail to save Nora and Hope needed to witness it, so one team told
another team to make such a scene, and somewhere down the game of telephone we
got a scene with a desired effect but without a cause. There was no pressure on
Nora and Snow. She wasn't saving him by letting go, because he wasn't in any
danger yet. So it just feels arbitrary.||

There are a few other similar issues throughout the game. Sometimes it feels
like scenes just... happen, disconnected from everything else. I noticed this
enough for it to bug me, but not enough for it to ruin the story for me. I have
seen that it ruined the story for some others though, and I don't blame them.
I'm glad Square Enix eventually cleaned up their production pipelines, because
this was kinda rough.

### Books

This was the era in which Square Enix was going really hard on multimedia
releases. It had already started with FFVII Advent Children, and would hit its
peak with FFXV's collection of several books, side games, an anime, and a movie.
Some books would be added to the FFVII collection _after_ FFXII's books came
out, but I believe FFXIII was the first game for which books were released
alongside the game and were intended to be a part of the experience.

_Final Fantasy XIII Episode Zero -Promise-_ is a collection of short stories
giving more depth to each character's backstory. Most of the events depicted
here are either shown in game through flashbacks, or are referenced in passing.
However, a lot of detail is added, especially for Sazh, Vanille, and Fang.
There's a [community-created
table](https://www.reddit.com/r/finalfantasyxiii/wiki/index/#wiki_ffxiii_episode_0_.2Dpromise.2D)
that gives advice on when to read each chapter while playing through the game,
for maximum impact and avoidance of spoilers. I think this book definitely
enhanced my experience playing through the game, but it's pretty rough. The
translation is not great, and it's clear that it didn't go through much editing.
Worth picking up if you _really_ want all the detail you can get, especially for
the Sazh, Vanille, and Fang sections.

_FFXIII -Episode i-_ is an extended epilogue for the game. It _sort of_ serves
as a bridge between FFXIII and its sequel by injecting a cliffhanger, but
_FFXIII-2 Fragments Before_ (which I'll cover in my review of FFXIII-2) does a
better job of that. Really it just answers some questions that the game's ending
didn't have time for, because answering them would have ruined the pacing for no
reason. Stuff like ||how many people died in that disaster? What does society
look like now? What are the party members' relationships now that they are no
longer bound together by fate?|| and so on. It's about the same quality as the
other book. Worth a read if you want more content about these characters.

Overall, even though the quality of these books was questionable, I enjoyed
reading them. It's especially nice that I could read while playing, because this
game took me several weeks to finish. So I could just replace my evening reading
and get an enriched play experience. Also, as Final Fantasy takes over more of
my identity, starting a bookshelf for the series feels like the logical next
step.

### World

This is, by far, my favorite setting in the series. I haven't yet covered FFXV
and FFXVI, but I have already played them (and plan to play them again as part
of this retrospective series). So I've now at least experienced every single
mainline Final Fantasy world (except XI, but I'm not doing that). This setting
blows the rest out of the water. It's got such interesting and refreshing
worldbuilding that it's made me feel inspired to get back into some of my own
worldbuilding projects I never finished.

I said earlier that I didn't need the data log in order to understand the story,
and that I didn't really use it while I played. That's true. I followed the
story fine without cracking it open past the fourth chapter. However, _after_
the story ended (and I was already satisfied with the ending), I **devoured**
the data log. I then found a [94-page fan-made lore
document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-1qngbEYvtgp8voGTe3H2w50R3qpkOlXrM2HxZyqovI/edit?usp=sharing)
that gave me even more detail, and devoured it as well. This document is great,
as it avoids spoilers for the other games in the trilogy while being as detailed
as possible about what can be learned about the world from FFXIII specifically.

I think learning about the world was one of my greatest joys while playing
through this game, so I don't want to give away all the cool details here. It
would also be massive blocks of spoilers, and this review is far too long
already. Instead of doing all that, I will once again point you towards that
94-page fan-made lore document. It does a fantastic job explaining the world,
but it does assume you've already played the game. It does a far better job than
I could have.

I'll just cover the general stuff. My favorite fantasy worlds are the "weird"
ones. The more unusual they are, the more interesting I find them. I like
fantasy because I want to experience infinite worlds that are all different from
each other, not because I want to see the same set of genre tropes again and
again. This world absolutely nailed that experience for me. Additionally, it's
clearly built from the top down as an interesting mythology meant to contain
multiple stories, rather than just the backdrop tailor-made for this one story.
That gives it an iceberg-like effect, where there's always more interesting
detail beneath the surface. Even if you don't see it directly, it supports the
story in the background and keeps everything connected. It's an extremely well
thought out and expertly crafted world.

I love Sci-Fi, and I love Fantasy. The weirder the better, for both. This game
fuses those two things together in such a cool way that feels like it was
designed for my tastes, specifically. It plays with those genres, mixing them
together and pitting them against each other just as much as the story's
multitude of worldviews are blended and contrasted. This game paints with genre
as pigment. It then ties all those interesting textures back into the mythology
and the themes in such gorgeous ways. I love it dearly.

### Characters

Even though I have issues with some of the character designs, I think the
narrative side of these characters is really strong. The characters have deep
flaws and trauma, and excellent character development to overcome it. The way
their stories weave together to form the greater narrative is beautiful in a way
no other Final Fantasy game before this quite captured.

The Eidolons are a great use of the mythology to present these character arcs in
compelling ways. Each Eidolon is a personal summon unique to each character, and
first shows up at the inflection point of that character's story, almost always
when there is some doubt or hesitation. They are there to [see you grit those
teeth](https://youtu.be/yNaaOQYTB5A). They force each character to figure out
what they actually believe in, and cut through the anxiety. What's even more
interesting is that they are only possible to defeat by leaning into the each
characters' specific strengths and figuring out what is important to them.

I loved how _different_ these characters were allowed to be. Hell, they were
allowed to **hate** each other. There was so much drama and conflict within the
party, and that made it feel truly special when they finally came together and
healed.

I've already said plenty of controversial things in this review, but allow me to
add one more: I think the character drama in this game succeeds in a few places
that the darling RPG of the year in which I write this, Expedition 33, failed.
E33 is an excellent game, but I found myself disappointed with the character
interactions towards the end of the story. Of course, the party is _full_ of
drama throughout the story, but it never seems to... matter? The characters are
still forced into a full party at all times. ||It even takes a few characters
away for all of 20 seconds before bringing them back without spending a second
digging into the implications of that.|| It felt like the narrative was being
led by the concerns of gameplay, and not the other way around. I get it though.
That game gives you so many ways to build your teams that if they were to remove
pieces arbitrarily, the well-oiled machine you crafted would screech to a halt.
However, I think there would actually be some artistic merit to that.

This game actually does that! You spend significant time with gameplay systems
that are awkward and difficult to play with due to the party being unable to get
their shit together. It's a bit of dissonance in the music. Then, that discord
resolves into beautiful harmony as the gameplay systems click into place, the
characters begin to heal their trauma and learn from their mistakes, and the
team finally comes together---all at once! It's a beautiful moment that feels
like the entire symphony of the game is composed perfectly together. Even the
OST for this game contains tons of moments of dissonance that resolve into
beautiful textures. It's an intentional, cohesive package all the way through.

This is spoilers for an earlier Final Fantasy game, but in the context of what
I've been saying, even naming it here would spoil it. So I'll keep the name and
the contents of the spoilers separate: ||Final Fantasy VII|| ||does this, and
it's one of the things most praised about that game. You will likely spend a
significant portion of the game investing in Aerith as a core part of your
party. She's a perfect fit for party healer/mage due to how her limit breaks
work, and she's such an amazing character and core part of the story that it's
natural to include her. Then, she's ripped away. That feels sad enough in the
story, but it also makes you feel like your party build lost a limb and you need
to rethink everything. It's extremely powerful and one of the best parts of that
game.|| _That_ is the same kind of sauce FFXIII has going on. Meanwhile, in
||Expedition 33|| ||the only permanent character death is immediately replaced by another similar character who plays like an upgraded version and fills the same role in the party before you're able to really even feel the gameplay loss. There's meaning
in that similar role, too, but it's a missed opportunity that they didn't let
you linger with that "missing party member" feeling for longer.|| Final Fantasy XIII
maybe lets it linger for a bit too long, but it's worth it for the resolution.

I didn't write this to bash Expedition 33. I love that game. It's just been on
my mind all year, especially while I played Final Fantasy XIII, so it's easy to
bring up for comparison. I think there are more similarities between those two
games than FFXIII haters may want to admit. My intention is simply to lift up
Final Fantasy XIII.

#### Lightning

> "When we think there's no hope left, we keep looking until we find some."

I feel like even those who didn't enjoy FFXIII ended up liking Lightning. She's
one of the most badass and iconic protagonists in the entire series. Like every
character in this game though, she's flawed.

Lightning is relentless, determined... and more than a bit stubborn. She's
impulsive, and focuses on the first idea that comes to her head. The only thing
on her mind is the task ahead. I think the moment that best sums up how
Lightning acts during the early hours of the game is when Sazh shouts "Run!" and
then moments later "I meant away!" because Lightning started running towards the
nearest threat.

In some ways, Lightning is as much the poster girl for one of the main themes of
the game as she is for the game itself. She tries to take everything on herself,
without relying on or opening herself up to others. She doesn't stop to smell
the roses, because that would only slow her down. She feels like the whole world
is against her, and the only answer is to remain strong by never being
vulnerable.

Eventually, she learns that this behavior ends up hurting her and those around
her, even those she sought to protect. She realizes that relying on others is
another form of strength, not weakness.

Lightning's Eidolon, Odin, appears when ||she tries to reject Hope, who she had
been protecting and teaching to fight. She tries to go solo, once again, taking
on the whole world by herself. She said some hurtful things to Hope, trying to
get him to leave her. But when Odin appears and attacks Hope, she protects him.
She didn't mean those things she said. She was just trying to protect him, but
she was hurting him and herself. The fight isn't possible alone. Lightning can
only beat Odin and find strength by protecting Hope.||

#### Snow

> "Since when have heroes ever needed plans?"

A lot of people don't like Snow. He's got a hero complex. He's hotheaded, big,
loud, and somehow even more stubborn than Lightning. I didn't like him either at
the start. That's the whole point!

It's not until Hope confronts him that he finally faces the guilt and anxiety he
had been bottling up inside. He didn't know how he could make up for his guilt,
or what he should do. All he can do is keep trying to do the right thing. So he
does.

By the end, he is one of the most reliable members of the party. He tames his
emotions fights with his head as much as his fists. He steps back from trying to
always lead, and only acts like a leader when he knows his brashness would be an
encouragement to the party.

#### Vanille

> "Wishes aren't enough. Prayers either. This time I'm making a promise."

People _hate_ Vanille, but I think it's largely because of the localization
issues I talked about earlier. She's bubbly and energetic, and that gets on some
people's nerves. However, the key is that those are her defense mechanisms.
She's generally putting on a smile because she's trying to hide her troubles
from everyone else.

Vanille is secretly one of the most important characters in the story. ||She
spends the entire tale running from her past, and pretending to have lost her
memories to avoid Fang learning anything about what really happened hundreds of
years ago: Fang was the one who truly became Ragnarok and tore a hole in Cocoon.
At the end of the game, Fang is unable to manifest a complete Ragnarok
transformation capable of actually destroying Cocoon. This is because her Brand
was already burned out. Due to the way things play out, every other party
member's Brand also becomes burned out. Only Vanille's is left. It was Vanille's
intact Brand that allowed her and Fang to manifest complete Ragnarok
transformations in order to save Cocoon. She went from being the girl who ran
from her fate to the one who saved the world by fulfilling it in her own way.||

#### Sazh

> "Chocobo, we just can't catch a break, can we?"

I love Sazh. He's a rare JRPG party member to not only be older than his
twenties (without being presented as elderly), but to also already be a parent.
He knew from the start that he was getting in over his head, but he also refused
to let that get in the way of doing what he thought would protect his son. In
the middle of this very cocky and hotheaded party, he's refreshingly normal.

Sazh fights with guilt and anxiety. He worries that he isn't a good parent. He
worries he isn't good enough to be on the team. He worries about things that
aren't even his fault. He assigns all blame onto himself, no matter what. In one
of the most raw scenes in the entire series, ||he nearly takes his own life.||

But how could he not be a great parent when he's going to such great lengths,
even standing up to his greatest fears in order to save his son? How could he
not belong on the team when they clearly rely on him and would have failed
without him so many times? How could he be at fault for things so entirely
outside of his control?

Sazh learns that supporting others also means taking care of himself. He learns
to accept the love that others show him, which he clearly deserved, despite
being unable able to see that.

#### Hope

> "You want to die? You can't! I won't let you."

Hope is another character despised by players. He's pretty whiny and irrational
at the start of the story. He lacks any ideals of his own. He's blinded by the
pain he's feeling, and lashes out at everything around him.

Hope's flaw is that he lacks... well, hope. He doesn't see a reason to believe
that anything will change for the better. He's just braced for the pain life has
ahead of him. He appears shocked during the first scene he's in when his mom
volunteers to take part in an armed rebellion. He simply can't understand why
she would risk such danger for a future that is impossible.

Fortunately, he does a complete 180. He becomes the beacon of hope for the
party. He never misses an opportunity to state that he believes everything will
be okay, and that they'll figure it out somehow. His line at the end of the game
is a perfect representation of his entirely baseless hope being entirely
correct. He says that ||if they have the power to destroy Cocoon, they have the
power to save it. It ends up literally being the power of Ragnarok that saves
the day.||

#### Fang

> "I'll tear down the sky if it'll save her."

Fang is a mirror of Lightning. They are from separate worlds with cultures that
could not be more different. They spent their entire lives believing the other
was their enemy. Only, once they stopped to talk, they found common ground. Both
do what they do in order to protect their loved ones. One of my favorite scenes
in the game is when they realize this and begin understanding each other.

Fang's biggest flaw is how she holds onto her belief that the people of Cocoon
are the enemy for too long. It doesn't take long for Vanille to see that
everyone there is also just human, not some monster. It takes Fang quite a bit
longer.

She also takes longer than anyone to truly believe in their power together. All
the way at the end of the game, she ||tries to take on the burden alone once
again and become Ragnarok to destroy Cocoon in order to save Vanille. It's only
after a miracle brings them back together that she finally accepts that letting
others in is true strength.||

### Themes

Contrary to popular belief, I think this game is pretty rich with themes. There
are certainly more than I've listed here, but I just wanted to cover what stood
out to me. Not only are these themes well supported by the story, they are woven
into the mythology of the setting itself in really clever ways. This entire
world is _singing_ these themes to the heavens.

#### Fate and Purpose

Let's start with the obvious one. Look, every Final Fantasy game is about fate
in one way or another. The game literally starts with gods reaching down to
mortals and sending them on a grand quest. It's hard not to see that as fate.
However, I'd like to focus on a more narrow interpretation: finding one's own
purpose.

This is a world quick to assign purpose to everyone and everything. Even the
gods themselves were given direct, specific purposes by their creator at the
time of their birth. Both entire worlds of Cocoon and Pulse were created for a
grand purpose, ||to find and open the divine gate.|| If something was not born
with an explicit purpose, it can be given one at any time. Even without gods and
magic, society places expectations on its members to fulfil certain roles.

What this story shows time and time again, is that such externally assigned
purposes are not ultimately what you should follow. They are dangerous,
exploitative by nature, and don't bring true happiness to those who succeed. In
fact, those whose purpose runs its course, success or failure, are set aside as
tools. We see l'Cie either turned to crystal or zombie-like Cie'th upon
completing the task laid out for them. ||Cocoon was born specifically to die.||
We even see Fal'Cie die when their purpose is complete.

Instead, this game shows how one can use the situation and gifts given to them
in order to determine their own purpose. This is most obvious with ||Ragnarok
saving Cocoon,|| but it goes even deeper into the mythology of the world as
well: ||Etro, the goddess who gave humanity a small bit of chaos that she called
heart, originally had no purpose and was immediately discarded upon her
creation. She became the goddess of death and the mother of humanity by her own
will. She even sits behind the divine gate the other gods are seeking, having
succeeded before any of them despite never being given that task.||

#### Family

This story plays with the concept of Family quite a lot. We see many
perspectives on what makes a family. Not all of them positive, but the game
makes it pretty clear which definitions of family it considers healthy.

Lightning and Serah are sisters, and the only blood family either of them have.
Sazh is a father. Snow is engaged to Serah. Hope lost his mother, but reconciled
with his father. Fang and Vanille were raised together, and see each other as
sisters. The party comes together as a found family over the course of the
story. All of these relationships are behind each character's motivation in the
story.

On the other side, Fal'Cie are created by other Fal'Cie and fit into a strict
hierarchy of service and purpose. This is the toxic definition of family shown
by the antagonists. Every evil deed is performed to seek the approval of one's
progenitors. Barthandelus, arguably the main antagonist, is even doing so ||out
of the desire to see his absentee mother again after centuries of missing her.||

The literal final boss of the game plays with this theme too. ||Orphan, as a
concept, can not exist without parents who lived long enough to birth it and
then died. The first phase of the fight includes a mother figure and a father
figure, brought together as one. Orphan itself only truly emerges once they are
dead.||

#### People are People, No Matter Where They're From

The people of Cocoon believe that "Pulse is hell." That phrase is uttered
verbatim many times throughout the story by residents of Cocoon. Nobody can ever
really elaborate on why. That belief has been strongly ingrained into the
culture for so long that nobody questions the reasoning anymore. The government
enforces it. The schools teach it. It is a Cocoon resident's greatest fear to be
sent to Pulse.

On the other side, the people of Pulse believe that the people of Cocoon are
liars and thieves who have wronged Pulse so deeply that they all deserve to die.
They believe that Cocoon is full of heartless monsters who would turn to
violence at the first opportunity. They are raised in training, ready to be
selected to be sent off to war so they can fulfill their duty by destroying an
entire continent.

But then Fang and Vanille end up on Cocoon, without weapons. They try to blend
in, and end up learning that the people of Cocoon may have a different culture
than them, but they certainly aren't heartless monsters. Later in the story, as
the other party members meet the pair from Pulse, they come to learn the same
lesson: These artificial divisions built between people are tools of
manipulation, and the reasons for war are contrived the powerful.

The manipulation went so deep that the people of Cocoon couldn't even tell you
what a Pulse Fal'Cie looked like. There was one sitting right outside Bodhum,
incredibly visible on the horizon for miles around. But since the government
assured them it was safe, they never thought twice about it. ||Of course,
getting the people used to this Fal'Cie being there was all a part of
Barthandelus's plan, so he wielded his governmental control to manipulate the
people into believing it was safe.|| The government simultaneously convinced the
people that a great threat was constantly looming, and that they had conquered
that threat so thoroughly that the people didn't need to know anything about it.
Straight out of the fascist playbook.

#### Taking on Everything Alone, and Self-Destructive Tendencies

Finally, what I think is the actual central theme of the game. Every single
character falls into this trap. Each of them has many different methods and
motivations, but they all start out by retreating inwards and shutting others
out.

Lightning attempts to face the whole world with violence, cutting her way
through anything in her path. She knows her path is self destructive, so she
insults others to get them to leave so they won't get pulled along with her.

Snow wants to be the hero everyone needs. He thinks that heroes always know what
to do, they never need help from others, and they never back down. Ultimately,
that's too big a burden for anyone to bear. He fails. It costs Nora her life,
and he is left desperately searching for a new purpose.

Vanille hides her knowledge of the past from Fang so that Fang doesn't have to
face what they've done. Either their failure, or the damage they did
successfully cause. She continues to run from what causes her pain, but it all
catches up with her eventually, and the lies she told hurt those around her.

Sazh is a good father, but he doesn't allow himself to feel any appreciation for
it. He's a case of "men would rather go on an epic quest to kill god than go to
therapy. He doesn't allow the blame to lie on anything or anyone other than
himself, even when others are trying to apologize to him.

Upon losing his mother, Hope spirals into a quest for revenge. He thinks of
nothing other than getting payback for his mother's life. He even gets wrapped
into a tale of gods and magic, and only considers how that might help him get
vengeance. He doesn't care about his own wellbeing, who else gets hurt on that
path, or if what he's chasing is even justice in the first place.

Fang attempts to shoulder the burden of ||Ragnarok|| alone, shoving the entire
party aside like Lightning did earlier in the game. It's heavily implied that
||this is exactly what she did when Fang and Vanille were first sent to Cocoon||
as well. This ends very poorly for everyone involved, herself included.

Every single time, it proves to be the incorrect choice. Every single time, the
situation is remedied when the characters finally reach out to each other for
support and rely on each others' strengths. Each time they do so, they need to
open up and be vulnerable with each other. The story does _not_ say it will be
easy, but it does say that it's always the best path.

# Final Thoughts

**Rating: 9/10**  
_Playtime: 39 hours_

For better or worse, this is a game that trusts the player to read between the
lines and interpret some things themselves. I see people beg games to do this
more often, but when this game actually did it, it was misunderstood. People
didn't give it a proper chance, and assumed it had no depth when they barely
skimmed its surface. In reality, there's more depth here than any other Final
Fantasy game before it. It's a shame that a work of art that respects the
audience enough to not spoon-feed them everything, is assumed to be lacking any
points worth hearing. I wish we had more games like this. It's been so fun to
analyze.

It still has flaws, mostly in pacing and scene direction. The boring parts last
too long, and there's just too much filler content. The localization has severe
blunders due to mismanaged development cycles. It has some presentation issues
that don't do it any favors.

Still, this will forever be one of my favorites.
