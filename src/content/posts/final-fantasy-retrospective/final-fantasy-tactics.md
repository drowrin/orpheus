Final Fantasy Tactics consistently places among the highest ranked games in the
series. It's undeniably a high quality game, and it has captured the hearts of
many fans for good reason. Unfortunately, despite having been looking forward to
it, this one's really not for me.

My first ever introduction to the Final Fantasy series was when my cousin let me
play a bit of her copy of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. I was just a kid---too
young to understand the tactics element of the game at all, but it was pretty.
My memories of that time are fuzzy. However, when I would start playing Final
Fantasy XIV many years later, it was because of Tactics Advance that I knew what
Black Mages and Dragoons were.

With those vague, fond memories kicking around in the back of my head, I
continued to hear that Final Fantasy Tactics was a legendary, timeless classic.
Since I'm already a fan of tactical RPGs, I've been looking forward to FFT since
I started this retrospective. At first, I put it off because I wanted to play it
alongside FFXII. Then, with the announcement of the Ivalice Chronicles remake, I
decided to wait until that came out.

This review is a little delayed. It took me a while to finish the game, and I've
completed a whole other Final Fantasy title before I felt motivated to write
this. Unfortunately, despite going into this game hoping to love it, things
didn't end up working out that way.

I can see how someone else could love this. This game holds a particular set of
game design values that don't align at all with what I enjoy, but someone who is
a fan of the flavor this game is selling will have a fantastic time. I just
happen to have the gene that ~~makes cilantro taste like soap~~ makes me
uninterested in filler party members, for example.

I think it's quite possible that things would have turned out differently had I
played this in its original form, when it was still a relatively new game.
Though that would have required my brain to be developed enough to actually
comprehend the words "tactics" and "RPG". At this point, I've played tons of
other games that fall under those genres, combined or not. I've experienced the
quality of life improvements that have come with modern game design. More
importantly, I've learned the styles of gameplay that I enjoy. It's impossible
to turn off the part of my brain that draws comparisons between these things.
The Final Fantasy Tactics experience suffered for it.

# The Review

I played the brand new "The Ivalice Chronicles" release of the game. This one
has voice acting for the first time, as well as improved graphics and UI. It
also has a few quality of life improvements---most notably a moderately faster
progression system during the early hours, the ability to skip random
encounters, and more information included in game menus instead of requiring the
use of manuals and wiki pages. My main criticism of this release is that I don't
think they leaned into the quality of life improvements nearly as much as they
could have.

For example, we can see that each map is a full 3D environment, as we get a full
3D spin around each one upon loading it. However, possible camera angles are
still restricted to the original 4 diagonals, with a tiny amount of extra
vertical tilt. I have to assume this was a conscious choice to keep the game as
similar as possible to the original, but it would have been so much easier to
play if the camera was fully unlocked.

The combat controls are another example. They were improved with the addition of
an undo button, which is huge on its own, but they could have looked to other
games for examples of what could have done better. For example, a common user
experience optimization in these kinds of games is to display the area a unit
can reach with its attacks in addition to its movement range. Even better, a
single click on an enemy can often place a unit just close enough to attack that
enemy, and initiate the attack. _Even better_, some games default to movement
controls instead of a menu, because that's probably what you're doing most of
the time anyways and you can always back out to the action menu if you need to
do something specific.

There are numerous other smaller places that _could_ have been improved. These
feel like missed opportunities at best, and intentional choices to release a
less ergonomic game at worst. Many of these good tactical RPG experiences are
_other Square Enix releases_. It's not like they weren't aware of them. I don't
think these improvements would have ruined the game's identity. This kind of
"preservation" of the original game, warts and all, over making simple and
obvious improvements is a consistent issue throughout this version of the game.
This seems unnecessary, since the game _also_ bundles the original game,
unchanged.

## Visuals

I rather like the look of the original game. The Ivalice Chronicles version adds
much higher resolution versions of the same sprites, in a painterly style that
closely mimics the original sprites. They look like AI upscaled sprites. I
_almost_ prefer the original look, as I think these new ones are just a little
too over-smoothed and the exaggerated proportions don't look as good without the
limitations of low resolution pixel art. However, I do think it's an overall
upgrade, especially because of some specific map textures such as water.

Cutscene direction was a real highlight for me. A lot of emotion was squeezed
out of very small character sprites, and it was mostly due to positioning and
timing. I was also impressed with the number of sprite animations dedicated to
these scenes compared to other games that had come out around then. Despite
being a 2d game, this has more expressive and emotional scenes than FFVII, which
released in the same year.

I was surprised to find that this game didn't run particularly well for me. It's
not like this game pushes the envelope of modern graphics. It's a handful of 2D
sprites on a painterly, low-poly 3D map that's intentionally limited in scope.
It's a touch-up of an almost 30 year old game. Yet, my framerate fluctuated so
wildly that I thought my new monitor was malfunctioning. There's a well-known
issue with Variable Refresh Rate OLED screens in which framerates with extreme
fluctuations can cause the whole screen to flicker in brightness. I've never
seen it more strongly than what I observed while playing this game. I had to
change my monitor settings to prevent the headaches it was giving me. I think
this issue gets hidden by the limited camera movement and low-framerate
animations of the sprites. It's a bummer for a full-price release of a very old
game to have issues like this.

## Audio

Unfortunately, much like my [Final Fantasy XII
review](https://drowrin.com/posts/final-fantasy-xii/#audio), I didn't end up
loving this soundtrack. Pretty much all of my thoughts from that review apply
here as well. These songs are very pretty, but they don't grab me emotionally
like most of the rest of the series does. A friend described the soundtracks for
these games as "tapestries" that evoke the feeling of a place, but not the
emotion of the individual. I think that's spot-on, and I couldn't possibly find
any better words to describe these songs than that.

Interestingly, while trying to pick out a few tracks that stood out to me, I
ended up picking all Hitoshi Sakimoto tracks. Curious. I went back to check my
FFXII review, and sure-enough, all Hitoshi Sakimoto. I think I just don't
particularly enjoy the work of Masaharu Iwata, unfortunately. I see that Hitoshi
Sakimoto was the sole composer on Vagrant Story. That's a good sign for my
future enjoyment of that game's soundtrack, when I get to it someday.

Here are a handful of tracks that I found particularly pretty and/or engaging:
- [Hall of Worship](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=sV5FtIgxCNI)
- [Remnants](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh4XJPm_6bE)
- [Pressure](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=DoReAC0DhF8)

Just like the rest of this game, even though it isn't for me in particular, I
could see how this could be someone's favorite soundtrack in the series. I don't
know much about music, but these songs strike me as exceptionally well-crafted,
from the composition to the performance. They have a feeling of having been
honed to perfection with great attention to detail. Unfortunately, I think I
just like a bit more _imperfection_ in my music.

Fortunately, I think the voice acting is very, very good. It's clear that the
performers were directed to keep the emotion levels within a very particular
bounded range, but they still killed it. I think the voice acting is the _main_
reason to play this version of the game over any other, and the reason I feel
totally satisfied having paid full price for it.

## Gameplay

This is where the game being **not for me** hits the hardest.

I love a good job system. Final Fantasy V earned _so much_ favor from me for its
job system alone, even if I didn't love much of the rest of the game. Part of
the reason I'm such a huge fan of FFX-2 is because of its excellent job system
implementation. I had heard that this game had one of the best ones in the
series so I was excited to get to it. Unfortunately, the best thing I can say
about it is that I can see why someone else might like it.

The jobs of this game are arranged in a big tree, which was apparently hidden
knowledge in the original game. To unlock a more advanced mage job, you must
first have a unit progress through several more basic mage jobs. For example,
Summoner requires levels in Time Mage, which requires levels in Black Mage,
which requires levels in Chemist (though not a mage, it starts the mage tree). I
don't have a direct issue with this tree system, but I found it mostly tedious.
It meant I'd have to invest a lot more time in my units to play as jobs I don't
want anything from. This also meant that I'd either have to grind between story
battles or play through those story battles with jobs I didn't want to use.
Neither option is fun for me. However, I could see how planning out long-term
builds and timing the swaps between jobs on the tree to consistently have a
strong team the entire time could be very enjoyable for someone.

Where it really falls apart for me is the progression system. You don't earn Job
Points after battles, when enemy units die, or anything like that. Each unit
earns Job Points from successfully completing an action. That action can be
hitting an enemy, landing a healing spell or buff, or even smacking your allies.
No matter what action you take, the amount of Job Points earned is the same. So,
if you can give every unit something to do every turn, they'll earn character
progression every turn. This encourages every unit to have a free, repeatable
self-targeting buff equipped, or at least a weak attack to use against allies.

This has several implications. First, units that take more turns will make
progress faster. Second, a significant amount of playtime will be taken up
instructing your units to take entirely useless actions that do nothing but
waste time for the sake of grinding up some Job Points. Worse, sometimes you'll
be instructing them to take actions that would logically be nonsensical or
harmful, such as hitting an ally in the back of the head with a rock. You can
even enter a random battle, kill everyone except one unit, and then have your
entire squad start standing around and doing nothing. This is the most efficient
leveling strategy in the game. You're telling me that my units could just be
doing squats out in a field to level up, and they haven't been doing that
between fights already? It doesn't make sense in the fiction, and it doesn't
make sense from a gameplay perspective. When I first _accidentally_ did this by
hitting an ally with a rock before I understood the controls, I laughed at how
comically absurd it was that I earned JP from it. I realized later in horror
that this was the main progression system. I _really_ hate that.

I'm a big fan of gameplay systems being designed to reward you for playing the
game in the most fun way possible. I find it lame when there's a repetitive way
to make progress efficiently. Ideally, engaging with the game in the way that
makes your characters do cool things or making the most tactical choices would
be the most rewarding. Imagine if, for example, characters earned Job Points at
the end of a battle based on how well the battle was executed. Some factor of
taking less damage and finishing the battle faster earning you more progress.
Then you'd be encouraged to make bold plays that feel awesome to pull off!
Actually, I don't have to imagine. I've played games like this, and it's lovely.
Instead, you have to work _around_ the game to play efficiently. I think I can
see why some people like that. There's a certain feeling of cleverness that
comes from doing something outside the box like that. Unfortunately, I just
don't enjoy feeling like I'm clever for breaking the design bounds of the game.
I want to optimize perfectly _within_ the box.

"Just don't cheese the character progression system then," I can hear you
saying. Unfortunately, I've got pretty limited options. If I _didn't_ do that, I
think I'd like this game even less. The amount of grinding necessary would be
insane. You earn Job Points at a rate of a few dozen per _successful_ turn.
There are some abilities in the game that I would very much like to use that
cost _thousands_ of Job Points, not including the hundreds or thousands of Job
Points required to unlock the relevant job in the first place. Even with perfect
planning, I don't think I'd unlock any of the cool abilities I'd want to use.
Worse, going into the game blind, I didn't know which abilities were cool or
not! I wasted a lot of Job Points on abilities that I immediately discovered
were not worth it.

A related, smaller annoyance is that this also applies to enemies. Every battle
begins with the first couple actions taken by an enemy unit causing them to
level up. This just strikes me as unnecessary. Sure, the enemies end up getting
a tiny stat increase in a few cases, but I don't think it ever actually impacted
my gameplay. It just meant that more time was wasted playing the level up
animation. My preference is that the time the game spends on enemy turns be as
fast as possible. There's a fast forward button in this version of the game, but
it still feels like a waste of time with extremely limited utility.

I also wasn't a huge fan of the combat itself. I like tactical gameplay, but
surprisingly for a game with Tactics in the name, I didn't actually feel much
was tactical about it. I tried to take cover, and enemies just shot over it. I
tried to take the high ground, and enemies just scaled it. I tried to create a
defensive line, and enemies just walked around it. More often than not, combat
just boiled down to everyone staying in range of everyone else, and then it
became a game of pure stats, or worse:

The real challenge in each encounter was ensuring I had the right tools to deal
with it. I wasn't allowed to know ahead of time what those required tools were.
For this fight, I need to deal with a huge group of distant archers, so I need
either incredible mobility options or a pretty heavy investment into defensive
buffs and healing. For this other fight, I need a way to cleanse my units from
being turned to stone, ideally on multiple units so that I can't lose the fight
just from my healer getting turned to stone first. It goes on an on. What are
the solutions? Either already know ahead of time what you need, or grind
forever. If you grind infinitely, you can cram so many tools onto every
character that they can tackle any situation with ease. If you don't do that
ahead of time, you might get to a story fight, fail miserably, and have to back
out to the world map to grind until you earn the keys for this lock. All roads
lead to grinding.

Again, someone who has played the game multiple times and knows all of the
challenges ahead probably feels the satisfaction of game mastery by being able
to plan for all of these challenges. For me, on a blind first playthrough, it
was miserable.

Another set of mechanics I didn't enjoy was the set of base character stats,
including Bravery, Faith, and Zodiac Sign. These things have an impact of just
about every bit of RNG in the game. These things feel like they were
specifically designed to ensure that the RNG systems of the game weren't
entirely predictable, to force players into adapting to unexpected situations.
Maybe your main damage dealer has poor compatibility with the boss you're
fighting, so you should come up with an alternative strategy and lean on another
character. Unfortunately, this either means more grinding to fix the issue, or
just suffering through a fight that is harder than normal because RNG decided to
curse you today. I don't particularly find this fun.

_Theoretically_ this is a system that a player could have a perfect
understanding of (and I'm sure plenty out there do), and it would be another
system to express mastery of. _In practice_, for me, it just meant that the game
often felt arbitrary and out of my control. I would be put at severe
disadvantage, not because of an action I felt like I had control over, but
because I was just unlucky. It felt like another "gotcha" the game could throw
at me, like "Oho, you remembered steps seven through fifteen on the pre-attack
checklist, but the you forgot about the gobbledegook flux capacitor astral
alignment mechanic? To the dungeon." It can even prevent healing and buffs from
activating. This feels extra bad when positioning is an important mechanic for
those spells. I have executed perfect tactics by ensuring my units were in a
perfect cross configuration to take maximum advantage of the spell being cast at
the perfect time. Oops! My mage doesn't have perfect compatibility with all
other units. Spell missed two targets. Guess I'll go screw myself then.

Unfortunately, I didn't even enjoy the character building very much. There are
some really interesting abilities, but there are _also_ some really boring,
stupidly powerful ones. The choices are so obvious that I never felt like
deviating. I would be foolish to pick a passive ability other than making my
characters earn Job Points faster. There are few situations where any kind of
movement type is better than moving _faster_. Of course I always want some kind
of reliably successful ability to use when a unit has nothing better to do, to
at least earn JP. It would be cooler and more effective to teleport, but that's
one of the most expensive abilities in the game, several jobs deep in the tree.
Hard to fit that onto my non-mages without a _lot_ of grinding. I can always
stop using abilities meant to earn JP, but only after enough grinding to last
the rest of the game. _All roads lead back to grinding._

My last, and probably largest, gameplay complaint is about filler units. I've
talked many times before in this retrospective about how I prefer to feel
invested in my party members, and align their builds with their personalities
and/or roles in the story. This game made that _really hard_. Technically, every
unit has completely separate progression, and you can absolutely feel invested
in each one and see how differently their builds end up. Unfortunately, the
units you spend a significant amount of time with are not story relevant, just
filler units.

When I started the game, one of the early missions gave me Ramza and a full
party of units working with him. I was excited! So many names, I wonder what
will happen to them. I wonder what their personalities are like. They're all
starting as squires and chemists, with no real unique traits, but that's okay, I
can mold them according to their personalities. **They have none?** _They never
interact with the story at all?_ _**They were randomly generated???**_ I've
never been more disappointed with a party in this entire series. At least FFI
gave me character creation at the start. At least Guy talked to beavers in FFII.

This would have been a disappointment on its own, but it gets worse. See, there
_actually are_ story relevant party members. You just don't get access to them
until halfway through the game. Then you get more, _better_ story relevant party
members almost at the end of the game. **Of course** I'm using story relevant
characters whenever possible. They've got unique mechanics and voice lines,
extra dialogue during fights, and actual personalities! They're also generally
strong and fun to use in combat. However, there are limited slots in every
fight, so using them means sending the units I've invested in back to the bench.
This didn't feel great, not because I cared about my filler party members, at
all, but because I felt like a lot of my time was wasted. Of course, if I really
wanted to, I could grind for hours to catch these new units up on job progress.

_All roads lead back to grinding._

## Story

I have also often heard that this is one of the best stories in the franchise.
I'd like to break that down into a couple parts: The prose is incredibly rich
and if you like purple prose, you'll be eating good. The _plot_ however is...
fine. Above average.

I've seen these tropes plenty of times. I've spent plenty of time thinking about
the lines we arbitrarily draw between people, the way a lust for power can
change someone, and how we can be blinded by trust. I'm used to the church being
evil. I've experienced plenty of mature, dark, political stories. It's entirely
possible that this is one of those cases where an earlier work of art loses its
appeal to me because of all of the work I've experienced that was built off of
it. It's possible that this was incredibly fresh and unique at the time it
released. But for me, it's lost the spark. This experience is now the _baseline_
for me, and stories need to do something more interesting on top of it.

The story picked up pretty significantly in the second half, but still ||a dark
cult has infiltrated society and is influencing it towards the revival of their
dead god|| isn't really anything new for me anymore. It's cool, and a classic
for a reason, but it's also basically "everyone's first D&D campaign." I was
pleasantly surprised to see the story take a turn, but I wasn't particularly
surprised by the direction it turned towards.

I praised the cutscene direction earlier, and I want to reiterate that. The
execution of the story is extremely solid. It's just not a story I ended up
caring about very much.

# Final Thoughts

**Rating: 6/10**  
_Playtime: 27 hours_

I played three tactical RPGs this year alone, and this was my least favorite of
the bunch. That sounds harsh, but I think of that as less of an issue with this
game and more of a sign of how far this genre has come. I wish Square Enix
decided to take advantage of the advancements in the genre for this release.
They already had a preserved copy of the original game included, they could have
gone way harder on modernizing this game. This ended up feeling more than a bit
lazy, with the exception of the excellent voice acting.

This is 0/2 for Yasumi Matsuno games. I'm starting to think I may just not like
his style, unfortunately. Still going to give Vagrant Story a try someday
though.

For the Tactics fans, I have no beef with you. I truly don't think the issues I
have with this game are objective flaws. It's just a game that lies so far
outside of my tastes that I had a rough time with it.
