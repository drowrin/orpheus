My open source projects typically fall into one of two categories:

- tools I've created for myself because I want to use them
- experimentation with technology I've wanted to explore

Sometimes both (the most fun case)!

I've archived many projects that I stopped maintaining for one reason or
another. Usually because I stopped using them (and I'm usually the only user),
so it didn't feel worth the effort to maintain them. However, I keep these as
public archives so that the code is still available. I believe there is some
value in this, however small it might be in some cases.

Listed here are the projects I'm actively working on, or at least maintaining
because I use them.

## Orpheus

minimalist (yet overengineered) website

</hgroup>

https://github.com/drowrin/orpheus

The project powering this site! I wrote Orpheus because I wanted to experiment
with a few different kinds of web technology, and I also happened to want a
personal blog. I've tried a few site generators out there, but nothing beats
doing your own tinkering. If I want a feature, I'll make it! I'll get the
opportunity to learn more along the way too.

## Eurydice

discord bot for managing TTRPG groups

</hgroup>

https://github.com/drowrin/eurydice

This isn't a dice roller or a any form of rules automation. There are endless
solutions out there for that. This is an organization tool. It's designed to
help automate some common tasks and provide as much convenience as possible. It
has features for automatically including character names in discord nicknames
when a session is live, managing session-zero type notes like safety tools,
scheduling sessions and performing "ready checks", and so on.
